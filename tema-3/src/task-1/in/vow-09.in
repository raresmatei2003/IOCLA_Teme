sacred or profane therefore you must not in every case at least  take the higgledypiggledy whale statements however authentic in  these extracts for veritable gospel cetology far from it as  touching

would you travelyour thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee uponsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buyhim a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestriantrip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with arobust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to seawhy upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such amystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now outof sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why didthe greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surelyall this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of thatstory of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mildimage he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but thatsame image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the imageof the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it allnow when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i beginto grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of mylungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as apassenger for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and apurse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengersget seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoythemselves much as a general thingno i never go as a passengernor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as acommodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinctionof such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate allhonorable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kindwhatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myselfwithout taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what notand as for going as cookthough i confess there is considerable gloryin that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow inever fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciouslybuttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one whowill speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiledfowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the oldegyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see themummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramidsno when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mastplumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mastheadtrue they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar tospar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort ofthing is unpleasant enough it touches ones sense of honorparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land thevan rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all ifjust previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have beenlording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand inawe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from aschoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca andthe stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears offin timewhat of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broomand sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighedi mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangelgabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly andrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who ainta slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains mayorder me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have thesatisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else isone way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical ormetaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump ispassed round and all hands should rub each others shoulderbladesand be contentagain i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point ofpaying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a singlepenny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves mustpay and there is all the difference in the world between paying andbeing paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortableinfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but beingpaidwhat will compare with it the urbane activity with which a manreceives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestlybelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on noaccount can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consignourselves to perditionfinally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesomeexercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for as in this worldhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is ifyou never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part thecommodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand fromthe sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but notso in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in manyother things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it butwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as amerchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whalingvoyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has theconstant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me insome unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else anddoubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grandprogramme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came inas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensiveperformances i take it that this part of the bill must have runsomething like thisgrand contested election for the presidency of the united stateswhaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistanthough i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers thefates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage whenothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and shortand easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough icannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all thecircumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motiveswhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises inducedme to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into thedelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewilland discriminating judgmentchief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whalehimself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all mycuriosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his islandbulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with allthe attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and soundshelped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such thingswould not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with aneverlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas andland on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick toperceive a horror and could still be social with itwould they letmesince it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates ofthe place one lodges inby reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome thegreat floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wildconceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated intomy inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of themall one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the airchapter 2 the carpetbagi stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under myarm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good cityof old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday nightin december much was i disappointed upon learning that the littlepacket for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reachingthat place would offer till the following mondayas most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop atthis same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as wellbe related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind wasmade up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was afine boisterous something about everything connected with that famousold island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford hasof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and thoughin this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucketwas her great originalthe tyre of this carthagethe place where thefirst dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucketdid those aboriginal whalemen the redmen first sally out in canoesto give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too didthat first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden withimported cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales inorder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from thebowspritnow having a night a day and still another night following before mein new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became amatter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was avery dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly coldand cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i hadsounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silversowherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle ofa dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards thenorth with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom youmay conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure toinquire the price and dont be too particularwith halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of thecrossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there furtheron from the bright red windows of the swordfish inn there camesuch fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow andice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost layten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for mewhen i struck my foot against the flinty projections because fromhard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a mostmiserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing onemoment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds ofthe tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last dontyou hear get away from before the door your patched boots arestopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the streetsthat took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if notthe cheeriest innssuch dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either handand here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb atthis hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter ofthe town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky lightproceeding from a low wide building the door of which stoodinvitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for theuses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumbleover an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the flyingparticles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed citygomorrah but the crossed harpoons and the swordfishthis thenmust needs be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up andhearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interiordoorit seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred blackfaces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel ofdoom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and thepreachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weepingand wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backingout wretched entertainment at the sign of the trapmoving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from thedocks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw aswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintlyrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray and these wordsunderneaththe spouter innpeter coffincoffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thoughti but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose thispeter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim andthe place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidatedlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted herefrom the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had apovertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the veryspot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffeeit was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsiedas it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a

bechapter 3 the spouterinnentering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a widelow straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one ofthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very largeoilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in theunequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligentstudy and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry ofthe neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of itspurpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at firstyou almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the newengland hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dintof much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings andespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of theentry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea howeverwild might not be altogether unwarrantedbut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limberportentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of thepicture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in anameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drivea nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of indefinitehalfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you toit till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out whatthat marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but alasdeceptive idea would dart you throughits the black sea in a midnightgaleits the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsits ablasted heathits a hyperborean winter sceneits the breakingup ofthe icebound stream of time but at last all these fancies yielded tothat one portentous something in the pictures midst that once foundout and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faintresemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himselfin fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my ownpartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons withwhom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehornerin a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with itsthree dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whalepurposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act ofimpaling himself upon the three mastheadsthe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenisharray of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set withglittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knotsof human hair and one was sickleshaped

but a penny to this a penny moreand so on to the full glassthe cape horn measure which you may gulpdown for a shillingupon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered abouta table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander isought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated witha room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bedunoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint noobjections to sharing a harpooneers blanket have ye i spose you aregoin awhalin so youd better get used to that sort of thingi told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i shouldever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and thatif he the landlord really had no other place for me and theharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wanderfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up withthe half of any decent mans blanketi thought so all right take a seat supperyou want suppersupperll be ready directlyi sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on thebattery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it withhis jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the spacebetween his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail buthe didnt make much headway i thoughtat last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in anadjoining room it was cold as icelandno fire at allthe landlord saidhe couldnt afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in awinding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and holdto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but thefare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes butdumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in agreen box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direfulmannermy boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a deadsartaintylandlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is itoh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny theharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings hedonthe eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rarethe devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he herehell be here afore long was the answeri could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this darkcomplexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it soturned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get intobed before i didsupper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing notwhat else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of theevening as a looker onpresently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlordcried thats the grampuss crew i seed her reported in the offingthis morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys nowwell have the latest news from the feegeesa tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flungopen and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in theirshaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comfortersall bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles theyseemed an eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed fromtheir boat and this was the first house they entered no wonder thenthat they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen thewrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them outbrimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head uponwhich jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which heswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever nevermind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labradoror on the weather side of an iceislandthe liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does evenwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they begancapering about most obstreperouslyi observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and thoughhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by hisown sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as muchnoise as the rest this man interested me at once and since theseagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate thoughbut a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned iwill here venture upon a little description of him he stood full sixfeet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam ihave seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown andburnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in thedeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seemto give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was asoutherner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one ofthose tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia whenthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this manslipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became mycomrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by hisshipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite withthem they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington wheresbulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of himit was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almostsupernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myselfupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to theentrance of the seamenno man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good dealrather not sleep with your own brother i dont know how it is butpeople like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes tosleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange townand that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitelymultiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor shouldsleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleeptwo in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they allsleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock andcover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skinthe more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated thethought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being aharpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be ofthe tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all overbesides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be homeand going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me atmidnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been cominglandlord ive changed my mind about that harpooneeri shant sleepwith him ill try the bench herejust as you please im sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for amattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots andnotches but wait a bit skrimshander ive got a carpenters planethere in the barwait i say and ill make ye snug enough so sayinghe procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dustingthe bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinninglike an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last theplaneiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord wasnear spraining his wrist and i told him for heavens sake to quitthebed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planingin the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up theshavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove inthe middle of the room he went about his business and left me in abrown studyi now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot tooshort but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot toonarrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higherthan the planed oneso there was no yoking them i then placed thefirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wallleaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but isoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me fromunder the sill of the window that this plan would never do at allespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one fromthe window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds inthe immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend thenightthe devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldnt i steala march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to bewakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but uponsecond thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the nextmorning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might bestanding in the entry all ready to knock me downstill looking round me again and seeing no possible chance ofspending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed i beganto think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudicesagainst this unknown harpooneer thinks i ill wait awhile he must bedropping in before long ill have a good look at him then and perhapswe may become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no tellingbut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threesand going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneerlandlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep suchlate hours it was now hard upon twelve oclockthe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to bemightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no heanswered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley toriseyes hes the bird what catches the worm but tonight he went outa peddling you see and i dont see what on airth keeps him so lateunless may be he cant sell his headcant sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you aretelling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to saylandlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessedsaturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head aroundthis townthats precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldntsell it here the markets overstockedwith what shouted iwith heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the worldi tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly youd betterstop spinning that yarn to meim not greenmay be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but irayther guess youll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you aslanderin his headill break it for him said i now flying into a passion again atthis unaccountable farrago of the landlordsits broke aready said hebroke said ibroke do you meansartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it i guesslandlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in asnowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand oneanother and that too without delay i come to your house and want abed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other halfbelongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i havenot yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying andexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feelingtowards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexionlandlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highestdegree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what thisharpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend thenight with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsaythat story about selling his head which if true i take to be goodevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and ive no idea ofsleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord yousir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby renderyourself liable to a criminal prosecutionwall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty longsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy beeasy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrivedfrom the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealandheads great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one andthat one hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows sunday and itwould not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks isgoin to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just ashe was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string forall the airth like a string of inionsthis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showedthat the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at thesame time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of asaturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibalbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolatorsdepend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous manhe pays reglar was the rejoinder but come its getting dreadfullate you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed sal and meslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced theres plenty of roomfor two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that whyafore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in thefoot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night andsomehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his armarter that sal said it wouldnt do come along here ill give ye aglim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towardsme offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at aclock in the corner he exclaimed i vum its sundayyou wont see thatharpooneer tonight hes come to anchor somewherecome along thendo come wont ye comei considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i wasushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enoughwith a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any fourharpooneers to sleep abreastthere said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chestthat did double duty as a washstand and centre table there makeyourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round fromeyeing the bed but he had disappearedfolding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none ofthe most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i thenglanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre tablecould see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelfthe four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking awhale of things not properly belonging to the room there was ahammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also alarge seamans bag containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt inlieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bonefish hooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoonstanding at the head of the bedbut what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to thelight and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible toarrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare itto nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with littletinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round anindian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat asyou see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possiblethat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade thestreets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on totry it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggyand thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysteriousharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bitof glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in mylife i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kinkin the necki sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about thisheadpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time onthe bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood inthe middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought alittle more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold nowhalf undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said aboutthe harpooneers not coming home at all that night it being so verylate i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and bootsand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myselfto the care of heavenwhether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockerythere is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could notsleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and hadpretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i hearda heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come intothe room from under the doorlord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernalheadpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a wordtill spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical newzealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and withoutlooking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me onthe floor in one corner and then began working away at the knottedcords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i wasall eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some timewhile employed in unlacing the bags mouth this accomplished howeverhe turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight such a face it wasof a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over withlarge blackish looking squares yes its just as i thought hes aterrible bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and herehe is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn hisface so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not bestickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they werestains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of thisbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a storyof a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals hadbeen tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the courseof his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure andwhat is it thought i after all its only his outside a man can behonest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthlycomplexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completelyindependent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might benothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hotsuns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i hadnever been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced theseextraordinary effects upon the skin now while all these ideas werepassing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me atall but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commencedfumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and asealskin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest inthe middle of the room he then took the new zealand heada ghastlything enoughand crammed it down into the bag he now took off hishata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out with fresh surprisethere was no hair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but asmall scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head nowlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the strangerstood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quickerthan ever i bolted a dinnereven as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window butit was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of thisheadpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehensionignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed andconfounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid ofhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room atthe dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not gameenough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answerconcerning what seemed inexplicable in himmeanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showedhis chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him werecheckered with the same squares as his face his back too was allover the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty yearswar and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt stillmore his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogswere running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain thathe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whalemanin the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked tothink of it a peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his ownbrothers he might take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawkbut there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went aboutsomething that completely fascinated my attention and convinced methat he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapallor dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled inthe pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed imagewith a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days oldcongo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thoughtthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similarmanner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glisteneda good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothingbut a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savagegoes up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboardsets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between theandirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sootyso that i thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrineor chapel for his congo idoli now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling butill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow first he takesabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and placesthem carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit ontop and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings intoa sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into thefire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemedto be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out thebiscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a politeoffer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem tofancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all thesestrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises fromthe devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singingsome pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about inthe most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took theidol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocketas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcockall these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeinghim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his businessoperations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high timenow or never before the light was put out to break the spell in whichi had so long been boundbut the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal onetaking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it foran instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at thehandle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next momentthe light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk betweenhis teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help itnow and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling mestammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from himagainst the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he mightbe to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but hisguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill

bedyou gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk andthrowing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only acivil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him

to stop smoking in short and i willturn in with him but i dont fancy having a man smoking in bed withme its dangerous besides i aint insuredthis being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politelymotioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as tosayi wont touch a leg of yegood night landlord said i you may goi turned in and never slept better in my lifechapter 4 the counterpaneupon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrownover me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almostthought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full ofodd little particoloured squares and triangles and this arm of histattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure notwo parts of which were of one precise shadeowing i suppose to hiskeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirtsleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his isay looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchworkquilt indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke icould hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their huestogether and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that icould tell that queequeg was hugging memy sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was achild i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell mewhether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle thecircumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or otherithink it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a littlesweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or otherwas all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmymother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off tobed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the 21st junethe longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully butthere was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in thethird floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill timeand with a bitter sigh got between the sheetsi lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapsebefore i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the smallof my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the sunshining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in thestreets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worseand worseat last i got up dressed and softly going down in mystockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself ather feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a goodslippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me tolie abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best andmost conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room forseveral hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse thani have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunesat last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze andslowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eyes and thebefore sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felta shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen andnothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in minemy arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginablesilent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closelyseated by my bedside for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay therefrozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yetever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horridspell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glidedaway from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered itall and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself inconfounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour ioften puzzle myself with itnow take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling thesupernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness tothose which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan armthrown round me but at length all the past nights events soberlyrecurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive tothe comical predicament for though i tried to move his armunlock hisbridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightlyas though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rousehimqueequegbut his only answer was a snore i then rolled over myneck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt aslight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawksleeping by the savages side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby apretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in thebroad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name ofgoodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling andloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of hishugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded inextracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himselfall over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up inbed stiff as a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as ifhe did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dimconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning overhim meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivingsnow and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when atlast his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellowand he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out uponthe floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand thatif it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dressafterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequegunder the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but thetruth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what youwill it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay thisparticular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so muchcivility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudenessstaring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions forthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding neverthelessa man like queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were wellworth unusual regardinghe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tallone by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up hisboots what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but hisnext movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder thebed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred hewas hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that iever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on hisboots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transitionstageneither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilizedto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners hiseducation was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had notbeen a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubledhimself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savagehe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on atlast he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down overhis eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if notbeing much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhideonesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented himat the first go off of a bitter cold morningseeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that thestreet being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain viewinto the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure thatqueequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots oni begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat andparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible hecomplied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in themorning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to myamazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to hischest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up apiece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into waterand commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kepthis razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bedcorner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets ita little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against thewall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeksthinks i queequeg this is using rogerss best cutlery with avengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i cameto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and howexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always keptthe rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out ofthe room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting hisharpoon like a marshals batonchapter 5 breakfasti quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted thegrinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards himthough he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of mybedfellowhowever a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce agood thing the mores the pity so if any one man in his own properperson afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not bebackward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent inthat way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable abouthim be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think forthe barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in thenight previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they werenearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third matesand sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths andharpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with boskybeards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morninggownsyou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore thisyoung fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue andwould seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three dayslanded from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shadeslighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in thecomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightlybleached withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but whocould show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tintsseemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one arraycontrasting climates zone by zonegrub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in wewent to breakfastthey say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at easein manner quite selfpossessed in company not always thoughledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotchone of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor butperhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs asledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach inthe negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor mungosperformancesthis kind of travel i say may not be the very best modeof attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sortof thing is to be had anywherethese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance thatafter we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear somegood stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every manmaintained a profound silence and not only that but they lookedembarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without theslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentirestrangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet herethey sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all ofkindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though theyhad never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the greenmountains a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warriorwhalemenbut as for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among themat the head ofthe table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure icannot say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not havecordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with himand using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with itto the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteakstowards him but that was certainly very coolly done by him andevery one knows that in most peoples estimation to do anything coollyis to do it genteellywe will not speak of all queequegs peculiarities here how he eschewedcoffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention tobeefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrewlike the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and wassitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable haton when i sallied out for a strollchapter 6 the streetif i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandishan individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of acivilized town that

indian ocean or pacific whofail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did notreturning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon thisspecial errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to drivingsleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth calledbearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i founda small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives andwidows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieksof the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apartfrom the other as if each silent grief were insular andincommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there thesesilent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marbletablets with black borders masoned into the wall on either side thepulpit three of them ran something like the following but i do notpretend to quotesacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen waslost overboard near the isle

awondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savagewas the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance becausehe was the only one who could not read and therefore was not readingthose frigid inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives ofthe seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregationi knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fisheryand so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if notthe trappings of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that herebefore me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts

as the stormpelted door flew back uponadmitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregationsufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes itwas the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom hewas a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer inhis youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to theministry at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardywinter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merginginto a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of hiswrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developingbloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath februarys snow noone having previously heard his history could for the first timebehold father mapple without the utmost interest because there werecertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to thatadventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed thathe carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage forhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilotcloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight ofthe water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoes were oneby one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent cornerwhen arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpitlike most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since aregular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with thefloor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel thearchitect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple andfinished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular sideladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wifeof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair ofred worsted manropes for this ladder which being itself nicelyheaded and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivanceconsidering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in badtaste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with bothhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the manropes father mapplecast a look upwards and then with a truly sailorlike but stillreverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as ifascending the maintop of his vesselthe perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the casewith swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were ofwood so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse ofthe pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a shipthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was notprepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turnround and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladderstep by step till the whole was deposited within leaving himimpregnable in his little quebeci pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for thisfather mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity andsanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by anymere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some soberreason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseencan it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifieshis spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly tiesand connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of theword to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is aselfcontaining strongholda lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennialwell of water within the wallsbut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the placeborrowed from the chaplains former seafarings between the marblecenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its backwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beatingagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowybreakers but high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds therefloated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angelsface and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon theships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted intothe victorys plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angelseemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardyhelm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rollingoffserenest azure is at handnor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste thathad achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in thelikeness of a ships bluff

rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads theworld from thence it is the storm of gods quick wrath is firstdescried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it isthe god of breezes fair or

unassuming authority orderedthe scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side awayto larboardlarboard gangway to starboard midships midshipsthere was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and astill slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again andevery eye on the preacherhe paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded hislarge brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes andoffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and prayingat the bottom of the seathis ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of abell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones hecommenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towardsthe concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy  the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom  while all gods sunlit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down  to doom  i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there  which none but they that feel can tell oh i was plunging to  despair  in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him  mine he bowed his ear to my complaints no more the whale did me  confine  with speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne  awful yet bright as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god  my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i  give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the powernearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above thehowling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turnedover the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down uponthe proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of thefirst chapter of jonahand god had prepared a great fish to swallow upjonahshipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis oneof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet whatdepths of the soul does jonahs deep

him to the kelpy bottom of thewaters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but whatis this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is atwostranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson tome as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to usall because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenlyawakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finallythe deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners among men thesin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of thecommand of godnever mind now what that command was or howconveyedwhich he found a hard command but all the things that godwould have us do are hard for us to doremember thatand hence heoftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god wemust disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves whereinthe hardness of obeying god consistswith this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts atgod by seeking to flee from

lookest like it says the captaintheres thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lockcontains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captainlaughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors ofconvicts cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressedand dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds thelittle stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air isclose and jonah gasps then in that contracted hole sunk toobeneath the ships waterline jonah feels the heralding presentimentof that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest ofhis bowels wardsscrewed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightlyoscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards thewharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame andall though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquitywith reference to the room though in truth infallibly straightitself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which ithung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth histormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successfulfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but thatcontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor theceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hangs inme he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of mysoul are all in crookednesslike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed stillreeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of theroman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into himas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddyanguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and atlast amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him asover the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound andtheres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berthjonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleepand now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables andfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careeningglides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recordedsmugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will notbear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like tobreak but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her whenboxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind isshrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders withtrampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumultjonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging seafeels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the farrush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleavingthe seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sidesof the shipa berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fastasleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his deadear what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargyby that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to thedeck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment heis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks waveafter wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runsroaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yetafloat and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from thesteep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearingbowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards thetormented deepterrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all hiscringing attitudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known thesailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of himand at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter tohigh heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause thisgreat tempest was upon them the lot is jonahs that discovered thenhow furiously they mob him with their questions what is thineoccupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark nowmy shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but askhim who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answerto those questions but likewise another answer to a question not putby them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hardhand of god that is upon himi am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heavenwho hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye wellmightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on tomake a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and moreappalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicatinggod for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of hisdesertswhen wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast himforth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempestwas upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other meansto save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louderthen with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they notunreluctantly lay hold of jonahand now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the seawhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the seais still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth waterbehind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterlesscommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething intothe yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivoryteeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayedunto the lord out of the fishs belly but observe his prayer andlearn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep andwail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment isjust he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself withthis that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towardshis holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentancenot clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasingto god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliveranceof him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonahbefore you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as amodel for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of itlike jonahwhile he was speaking these words the howling of the shriekingslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher whowhen describing jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himselfhis deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemedthe warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away fromoff his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all hissimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to themthere now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over theleaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless withclosed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himselfbut again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowlywith an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake thesewordsshipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands pressupon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson thatjonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more tome for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i comedown from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sitand listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that otherand more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of theliving god how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of truethings and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in theears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he shouldraise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his godby taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he neverreached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowedhim down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore himalong into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked himten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his headand all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyondthe reach of any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whalegrounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then god heard theengulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto thefish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whalecame breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all thedelights of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry landwhen the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised andbeatenhis ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuringof the oceanjonah did the almightys bidding and what was thatshipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that was itthis shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot ofthe living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms fromgospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when godhas brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather thanto appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woeto him who in

or immortalhere i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this worldsor mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what isman that he should live out the lifetime of his godhe said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face withhis hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departedand he was left alone in the placechapter 10 a bosom friendreturning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg therequite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction sometime he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on thestove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face thatlittle negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with ajackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming tohimself in his heathenish waybut being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon goingto the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lapbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftiethpageas i fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him andgiving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment hewould then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at numberone each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it wasonly by such a large number of fifties being found together that hisastonishment at the multitude of pages was excitedwith much interest i sat watching him savage though he was andhideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenanceyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable youcannot hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought isaw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyesfiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare athousand devils and besides all this there was a certain loftybearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could notaltogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and neverhad had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shavedhis forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and lookedmore expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture todecide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellentone it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washingtonshead as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same longregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which werelikewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded ontop queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developedwhilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to belooking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded mypresence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance butappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellousbook considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the nightprevious and especially considering the affectionate arm i had foundthrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifferenceof his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you donot know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing theircalm selfcollectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i hadnoticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very littlewith the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whateverappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintancesall this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts therewas something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousandmiles from home by the way of cape horn that iswhich was the onlyway he could get therethrown among people as strange to him as thoughhe were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his easepreserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionshipalways equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophythough no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that butperhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious ofso living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a mangives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like thedyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digesteras i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in thatmild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it thenonly glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gatheringround the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain thestorm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible ofstrange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heartand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothingsavage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking anature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and blanddeceits wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began tofeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things thatwould have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thusdrew me ill try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindnesshas proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made somefriendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile atfirst he little noticed these advances but presently upon myreferring to his last nights hospitalities he made out to ask mewhether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat ithought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimentedwe then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain tohim the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few picturesthat were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that wewent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights tobe seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke andproducing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff andthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping itregularly passing between usif there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagansbreast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out andleft us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally andunbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed hisforehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said thathenceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that wewere bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in acountryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far toopremature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savagethose old rules would not applyafter supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our roomtogether he made me a present of his embalmed head took out hisenormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out somethirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table andmechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of themtowards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but hesilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stayhe then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removedthe paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemedanxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow ideliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply orotherwisei was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infalliblepresbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator inworshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do yousuppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven andearthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of aninsignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worshipto dothe will of godthat is worship and what is the will of godto doto my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to methat isthe will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wishthat this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particularpresbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with himin his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helpedprop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit withqueequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and thatdone we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciencesand all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chathow it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidentialdisclosures between friends man and wife they say there open thevery bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples oftenlie and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in ourhearts honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy loving pairchapter 11 nightgownwe had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals andqueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legsover mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and freeand easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations whatlittle nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt likegetting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the futureyes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent positionbegan to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselvessitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against theheadboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our twonoses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans we feltvery nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doorsindeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no fire in theroom the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth somesmall part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this worldthat is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself ifyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have beenso a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more butif like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crownof your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the generalconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm forthis reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a firewhich is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the heightof this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanketbetween you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air then thereyou lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystalwe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all atonce i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whetherby day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of alwayskeeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness ofbeing in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity arightexcept his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the properelement of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayeypart upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant andselfcreated darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of theunilluminated twelveoclockatnight i experienced a disagreeablerevulsion nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg thatperhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wideawake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffsfrom his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strongrepugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see howelastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend themfor now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by meeven in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joythen i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlords policy ofinsurance i was only alive to the condensed confidentialcomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friendwith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed thetomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a bluehanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the newlit lampwhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away tofar distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native islandand eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it hegladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few ofhis words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiarwith his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole storysuch as it may prove in the mere skeleton i givechapter 12 biographicalqueequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west andsouth it is not down in any map true places never arewhen a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in agrass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a greensapling even then in queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strongdesire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler ortwo his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest andon the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives ofunconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in his veinsroyalstuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity henourished in his untutored youtha sag harbor ship visited his fathers bay and queequeg sought apassage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement ofseamen spurned his suit and not all the king his fathers influencecould prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddledoff to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through whenshe quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other alow tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out intothe water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets withits prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand andwhen the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained herside with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoeclimbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon thedeck grappled a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go thoughhacked in piecesin vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended acutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king andqueequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and hiswild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented andtold him he might make himself at home but this fine young savagethissea prince of wales never saw the captains cabin they put him downamong the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar petercontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdainedno seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power ofenlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottomso he told mehewas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians thearts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and morethan that still better than they were but alas the practices ofwhalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be bothmiserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his fathersheathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what thesailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how theyspent their wages in that place also poor queequeg gave it up forlost thought he its a wicked world in all meridians ill die apaganand thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christianswore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queerways about him though now some time from homeby hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and havinga coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone hebeing very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no notyet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christianshad unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirtypagan kings before him but by and by he said he would returnassoon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however heproposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans theyhad made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of asceptre nowi asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his futuremovements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation uponthis i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of myintention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising portfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved toaccompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into thesame watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share myevery hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck ofboth worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the affectioni now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as suchcould not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me waswholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquaintedwith the sea as known to merchant seamenhis story being ended with his pipes last dying puff

after disposing of the embalmed head to a barberfor a block i settled my own and comrades bill using however mycomrades money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemedamazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up betweenme and queequegespecially as peter coffins cock and bull storiesabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very personwhom i now companied withwe borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my ownpoor carpetbag and queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we wentdown to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at thewharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg somuchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in theirstreetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but weheeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequegnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs iasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore andwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this insubstance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yethe had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was ofassured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimatewith the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers andmowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their ownscythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so queequegfor his own private reasons preferred his own harpoonshifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story aboutthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor theowners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry hisheavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about thethingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way inwhich to manage the barrowqueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes itfast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf whysaid i queequeg you might have known better than that one wouldthink didnt the people laughupon this he told me another story the people of his island ofrokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant waterof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl andthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braidedmat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship oncetouched at rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a verystately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthiscommander was invited to the wedding feast of queequegs sister apretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the weddingguests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this captainmarches in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself overagainst the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty theking queequegs father grace being saidfor those people have theirgrace as well as wethough queequeg told me that unlike us who at suchtimes look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copyingthe ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feastsgrace isay being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorialceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated andconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beveragecirculates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting

that two fellowbeings should be so companionable as though a white man were anythingmore dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobiesand bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have comefrom the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of theseyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkinshour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caughthim in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strengthsent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his sternin midsomerset the fellow landed with bursting

eyebut it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain tomind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had partedthe weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side toside completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poorfellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard allhands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay itseemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost inone ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point ofsnapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capableof being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeingthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in themidst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees andcrawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope securedone end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lassocaught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the nextjerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner wasrun into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the sternboat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a longliving arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimminglike a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and byturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam ilooked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be savedthe greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from thewater queequeg now took an instants glance around him and seemingto see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutesmore and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the otherdragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up

something like laplander snowshoes that they are so shut upbelted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter islandof by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams willsometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but theseextravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinoislook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island wassettled by the redmen thus goes the legend in olden times an eagleswooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infantindian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their childborne out of

herds of walruses and whaleschapter 15 chowderit was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly toanchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to nobusiness that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlordof the spouterinn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of thetry pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kepthotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousinhosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short heplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluckat the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping ayellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church tothe larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made acorner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the firstman we met where the place was these crooked directions of his verymuch puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeginsisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust beleft on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to sayit was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little inthe dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant toinquire the way we at last came to something which there was nomistakingtwo enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses earsswung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of anold doorway the horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the otherside so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallowsperhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but icould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sortof crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yestwo of them one for queequeg and one for me its ominous thinksi a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling porttombstones staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallowsand a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing outoblique hints touching topheti was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled womanwith yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the innunder a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injuredeye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollenshirtget along with ye said she to the man or ill be combing yecome on queequeg said i all right theres mrs husseyand so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leavingmrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs uponmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs husseypostponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a littleroom and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recentlyconcluded repast turned round to us and saidclam or codwhats that about cods maam said i with much politenessclam or cod she repeateda clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mrs husseysays i but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the wintertime aint it mrs husseybut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purpleshirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothingbut the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leadingto the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappearedqueequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for usboth on one clamhowever a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie theapparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowdercame in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friendshearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger thanhazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut upinto little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifullyseasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by thefrosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishingfood before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent wedespatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment andbethinking me of mrs husseys clam and cod announcement i thought iwould try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i utteredthe word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a fewmoments the savoury steam came forth again but with a differentflavor and in good time a fine codchowder was placed before uswe resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks ito myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head whatsthat stultifying saying about chowderheaded people but lookqueequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl wheres your harpoonfishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved itsname for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder forbreakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till youbegan to look for fishbones coming through your clothes the areabefore the house was paved with clamshells mrs hussey wore apolished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his accountbooks bound in superior old sharkskin there was a fishy flavor to themilk too which i could not at all account for till one morninghappening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermensboats i saw hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants andmarching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated headlooking very slipshod i assure yesupper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs husseyconcerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about toprecede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demandedhis harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said ievery true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not becauseits dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from thatunfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four years and a half withonly three barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor backwith his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders totake sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequegfor she had learned his name i will just take this here iron andkeep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod tomorrowfor breakfast menboth says i and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way ofvarietychapter 16 the shipin bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and nosmall concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had beendiligently consulting yojothe name of his black little godand yojohad told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon iteveryway that instead of our going together among the whalingfleet inharbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i sayyojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should restwholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in orderto do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myselfi ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as thoughit had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately shipmyself for the present irrespective of queequegi have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed greatconfidence in the excellence of yojos judgment and surprising forecastof things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rathergood sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but inall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designsnow this plan of queequegs or rather yojos touching the selectionof our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a littlerelied upon queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted tocarry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrancesproduced no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce andaccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determinedrushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle thattrifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut upwith yojo in our little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort oflent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer withqueequeg and yojo that day how it was i never could find out forthough i applied myself to it several times i never could master hisliturgies and xxxix articlesleaving queequeg then fasting on histomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire ofshavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolongedsauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were threeships up for threeyears voyagesthe devildam the titbit and thepequod devildam i do not know the origin of titbit is obviouspequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebratedtribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes ipeered and pryed about the devildam from her hopped over to thetitbit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her fora moment and then decided that this was the very ship for usyou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught iknowsquaretoed luggers mountainous japanese junks butterboxgalliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such arare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the oldschool rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfootedlook about her long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons andcalms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like afrench grenadiers who has alike fought in egypt and siberia hervenerable bows looked bearded her mastscut somewhere on the coast ofjapan where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher mastsstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne herancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshippedflagstone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all theseher old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertainingto the wild business that for more than half a century she hadfollowed old captain peleg many years her chiefmate before hecommanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and oneof the principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the termof his chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness andinlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and deviceunmatched by anything except it be thorkillhakes carved buckler orbedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor hisneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing oftrophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chasedbones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks weregarnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of thesperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thewsand tendons to those thews ran not through base blocks of land woodbut deftly travelled over sheaves of seaivory scorning a turnstilewheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tillerwas in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of herhereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempestfelt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutchingits jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble thingsare touched with thatnow when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one havingauthority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage atfirst i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort oftent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast itseemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conicalshape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limberblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of therightwhale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle ofthese slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and atthe apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres wavedto and fro like the topknot on some old pottowottamie sachems head atriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that theinsider commanded a complete view forwardand half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who byhis aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and theships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden ofcommand he was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling allover with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of astout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam wasconstructedthere was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance ofthe elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamenand heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker styleonly there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutestwrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from hiscontinual sailings in many hard gales and always looking towindwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursedtogether such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowlis this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door ofthe tentsupposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want ofhim he demandedi was thinking of shippingthou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketerever been in astove boatno sir i never havedost know nothing at all about whaling i dare sayehnothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn ive beenseveral voyages in the merchant service and i think thatmerchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see thatlegill take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest ofthe marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i supposenow ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchantships but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehitlooks a little suspicious dont it ehhast not been a pirate hastthoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think ofmurdering the officers when thou gettest to seai protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask ofthese half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulatedquakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and ratherdistrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or thevineyardbut what takes thee awhaling i want to know that before i think ofshipping yewell sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the worldwant to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahabwho is captain ahab siraye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this shipi am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himselfthou art speaking to captain pelegthats who ye are speaking toyoung man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fittedout for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew weare part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantestto know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a wayof finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clapeye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only onelegwhat do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whalelost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewedup crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped aboatah ahi was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched atthe hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as icould what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i knowthere was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeedi might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accidentlook ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thoudost not talk shark a bit sure yeve been to sea before now sureof thatsir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages inthe merchanthard down out of that mind what i said about the marchantservicedont aggravate mei wont have it but let us understand eachother i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feelinclined for iti do sirvery good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a livewhales throat and then jump after it answer quicki am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not tobe got rid of that is which i dont take to be the factgood again now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to findout by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order tosee the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then juststep forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then backto me and tell me what ye see therefor a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request notknowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest butconcentrating all his crows feet into one scowl captain peleg startedme on the errandgoing forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that theship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquelypointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited butexceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that icould seewell whats the report said peleg when i came back what did yeseenot much i repliednothing but water considerable horizon thoughand theres a squall coming up i thinkwell what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to goround cape horn to see any more of it eh cant ye see the world whereyou standi was a little staggered but go awhaling i must and i would and thepequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all this i nowrepeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed hiswillingness to ship meand thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcomealong with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into thecabinseated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon andsurprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along withcaptain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the othershares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowdof old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wardseach owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or anail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money inwhaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved statestocks bringing in good interestnow bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was aquaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and tothis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure thepeculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified bythings altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these samequakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters theyare fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeanceso that there are instances among them of men who named withscripture namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand inchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of thequaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundlessadventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with theseunoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character notunworthy a scandinavian seaking or a poetical pagan roman and whenthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with aglobular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness andseclusion of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters andbeneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to thinkuntraditionally and independently receiving all natures sweet orsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confidingbreast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidentaladvantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makesone in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature formed fornoble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramaticallyregarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seemsa half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature forall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness besure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but diseasebut as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite anotherand still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again fromanother phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstanceslike captain peleg captain bildad was a welltodo retired whalemanbut unlike captain pelegwho cared not a rush for what are calledserious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things theveriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not only been originallyeducated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism butall his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovelyisland creatures round the hornall that had not moved this nativeborn quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of hisvest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of commonconsistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing fromconscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himselfhad illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a swornfoe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straightbodied coat spilledtuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative eveningof his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in thereminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him muchand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensibleconclusion that a mans religion is one thing and this practical worldquite another this world pays dividends rising from a littlecabinboy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in abroad shadbellied waistcoat from that becoming boatheaderchiefmate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as i hintedbefore had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring fromactive life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remainingdays to the quiet receiving of his wellearned incomenow bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being anincorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hardtaskmaster they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems acurious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crewupon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospitalsore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quakerhe was certainly rather hardhearted to say the least he never usedto swear though at his men they said but somehow he got aninordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them whenbildad was a chiefmate to have his drabcoloured eye intently lookingat you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutchsomethinga hammer or a marlingspike and go to work like mad atsomething or other never mind what indolence and idleness perishedbefore him his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitariancharacter on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh nosuperfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it likethe worn nap of his broadbrimmed hatsuch then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when ifollowed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the deckswas small and there boltupright sat old bildad who always sat soand never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broadbrim wasplaced beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture wasbuttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed inreading from a ponderous volumebildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have beenstudying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to mycertain knowledge how far ye got bildadas if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmatebildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked upand seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleghe says hes our man bildad said peleg he wants to shipdost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to mei dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quakerwhat do ye think of him bildad said peleghell do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away athis book in a mumbling tone quite audiblei thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleghis friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i saidnothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chestand drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before himand seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high timeto settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage forthe voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paidno wages but all hands including the captain received certain sharesof the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned tothe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of theships company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling myown lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to thesea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubtthat from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275thlaythat is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyagewhatever that might eventually amount to and though the 275th lay waswhat they call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing andif we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing iwould wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and boardfor which i would not have to pay one stiverit might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princelyfortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of thosethat never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if theworld is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at thisgrim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have beensurprised had i been offered the 200th considering i was of abroadshouldered makebut one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful aboutreceiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heardsomething of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildadhow that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod thereforethe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly thewhole management of the ships affairs to these two and i did not knowbut what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say aboutshipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequodquite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at hisown fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with hisjackknife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that hewas such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heededus but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up foryourselves treasures upon earth where mothwell captain bildad interrupted peleg what dye say what layshall we give this young manthou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred andseventyseventh wouldnt be too much would itwhere moth and rust docorrupt but laylay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred andseventyseventh well old bildad you are determined that i for oneshall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust docorrupt it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though fromthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yetthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred andseventyseven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make ateenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred andseventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than sevenhundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so i thought at the timewhy blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want toswindle this young man he must have more than thatseven hundred and seventyseventh again said bildad without liftinghis eyes and then went on mumblingfor where your treasure is therewill your heart be alsoi am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg doye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i saybildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him saidcaptain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider theduty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphansmany of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of thisyoung man we may be taking the bread from those widows and thoseorphans the seven hundred and seventyseventh lay captain pelegthou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about thecabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in thesematters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would beheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round capehorncaptain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawingten inches of water or ten fathoms i cant tell but as thou artstill an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thyconscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee founderingdown to the fiery pit captain pelegfiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing yeinsult me its an allfired outrage to tell any human creature thathes bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to meand start my soulbolts but illillyes ill swallow a live goatwith all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye cantingdrabcoloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with yeas he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with amarvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded himalarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal andresponsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up allidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarilycommanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad whoi made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakenedwrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on thetransom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention ofwithdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways asfor peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no moreleft in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched alittle as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at lastthesqualls gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good atsharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jackknife here needsthe grindstone thats he thank ye bildad now then my young manishmaels thy name didnt ye say well then down ye go here ishmaelfor the three hundredth laycaptain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to shiptooshall i bring him down tomorrowto be sure said peleg fetch him along and well look at himwhat lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book inwhich he had again been burying himselfoh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he everwhaled it any turning to mekilled more whales than i can count captain pelegwell bring him along thenand after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that ihad done a good mornings work and that the pequod was the identicalship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the capebut i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that thecaptain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me thoughindeed in many cases a whaleship will be completely fitted out andreceive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible byarriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolongedand the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if thecaptain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort hedoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her tothe owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well tohave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into hishands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captainahab was to be foundand what dost thou want of captain ahab its all right enough thouart shippedyes but i should like to see himbut i dont think thou wilt be able to at present i dont knowexactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside thehouse a sort of sick and yet he dont look so in fact he aintsick but no he isnt well either any how young man he wont alwayssee me so i dont suppose he will thee hes a queer man captainahabso some thinkbut a good one oh thoult like him well enough nofear no fear hes a grand ungodly godlike man captain ahabdoesnt speak much but when he does speak then you may well listenmark ye be forewarned ahabs above the common ahabs been incolleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wondersthan the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes thanwhales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all ourisle oh he aint captain bildad no and he aint captain peleghes ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned kingand a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs didthey not lick his bloodcome hither to mehither hither said peleg with a significance inhis eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on boardthe pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himselftwas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who diedwhen he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig atgayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic andperhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warnthee its a lie i know captain ahab well ive sailed with him asmate years ago i know what he isa good mannot a pious good manlike bildad but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres agood deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jollyand i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mindfor a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stumpthat brought that about as any one might see i know too that eversince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been akind of moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will allpass off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee youngman its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing badone so goodbye to theeand wrong not captain ahab because he happensto have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wifenot three voyagesweddeda sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl thatold man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harmin ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has hishumanitiesas i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had beenincidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certainwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the timei felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i dont know whatunless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strangeawe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe wasnot exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it didnot disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemedlike mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me thenhowever my thoughts were at length carried in other directions sothat for the present dark ahab slipped my mindchapter 17 the ramadanas queequegs ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue allday i did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall for icherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligationsnever mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalueeven a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool or those othercreatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree offootmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before thetorso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of theinordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his namei say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in thesethings and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortalspagans and what not because of their halfcrazy conceits on thesesubjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the mostabsurd notions about yojo and his ramadanbut what of that queequegthought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be contentand there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail lethim be i say and heaven have mercy on us allpresbyterians and pagansalikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head andsadly need mendingtowards evening when i felt assured that all his performances andrituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the doorbut no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened insidequeequeg said i softly through the keyholeall silent i sayqueequeg why dont you speak its iishmael but all remained stillas before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundanttime i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked throughthe keyhole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room thekeyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one i could only seepart of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall but nothingmore i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the woodenshaft of queequegs harpoon which the landlady the evening previoushad taken from him before our mounting to the chamber thats strangethought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and heseldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be insidehere and no possible mistakequeequegqueequegall still something must have happenedapoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resistedrunning down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first personi metthe chambermaid la la she cried i thought something mustbe the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door waslocked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent eversince but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked yourbaggage in for safe keeping la la maammistress murder mrshussey apoplexyand with these cries she ran towards the kitchen ifollowingmrs hussey soon appeared with a mustardpot in one hand and avinegarcruet in the other having just broken away from the occupationof attending to the castors and scolding her little black boymeantimewoodhouse cried i which way to it run for gods sake and fetchsomething to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had a strokedepend upon itand so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairsagain emptyhanded when mrs hussey interposed the mustardpot andvinegarcruet and the entire castor of her countenancewhats the matter with you young manget the axe for gods sake run for the doctor some one while i pryit openlook here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegarcruetso as to have one hand free look here are you talking about pryingopen any of my doorsand with that she seized my arm whats thematter with you whats the matter with you shipmatein as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understandthe whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegarcruet to one side ofher nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedno i haventseen it since i put it there running to a little closet under thelanding of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me thatqueequegs harpoon was missing hes killed himself she cried itsunfortnate stiggs done over againthere goes another counterpanegodpity his poor motherit will be the ruin of my house has the poor lada sister wheres that

thelocksmith theres one about a mile from here but avast putting herhand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit i guess letssee and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequegssupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn withinhave to burst it open said i and was running down the entry alittle for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowingi should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with asudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the markwith a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slammingagainst the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there goodheavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and selfcollected rightin the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo ontop of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but satlike a carved image with scarce a sign of active lifequeequeg said i going up to him queequeg whats the matter withyouhe haint been a sittin so all day has he said the landladybut all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost feltlike pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almostintolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrainedespecially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards ofeight or ten hours going too without his regular mealsmrs hussey said i hes alive at all events so leave us if youplease and i will see to this strange affair myselfclosing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail uponqueequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he coulddofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a pegnor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence inthe slightest wayi wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan dothey fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be soyes its part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest hellget up sooner or later no doubt it cant last for ever thank godand his ramadan only comes once a year and i dont believe its verypunctual theni went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the longstories of some sailors who had just come from a plumpudding voyageas they called it that is a short whalingvoyage in a schooner orbrig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean onlyafter listening to these plumpuddingers till nearly eleven oclock iwent up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequegmust certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no therehe was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i beganto grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane tobe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold roomholding a piece of wood on his headfor heavens sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up andhave some supper youll starve youll kill yourself queequeg butnot a word did he replydespairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleepand no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous toturning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him asit promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but hisordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could notget into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the merethought of queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasyposition stark alone in the cold and dark this made me reallywretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wideawake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadanbut somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break ofday when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if hehad been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse ofsun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints butwith a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed hisforehead again against mine and said his ramadan was overnow as i before hinted i have no objection to any persons religionbe it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult anyother person because that other person dont believe it also but whena mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive tormentto him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn tolodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside andargue the point with himand just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bednow and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the riseand progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the variousreligions of the present time during which time i labored to showqueequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged hamsquattingsin cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the healthuseless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygieneand common sense i told him too that he being in other things suchan extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badlypained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculousramadan of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave inhence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast mustnecessarily be halfstarved this is the reason why most dyspepticreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters inone word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea firstborn on an undigested appledumpling and since then perpetuatedthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadansi then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled withdyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take itin he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a greatfeast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battlewherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in theafternoon and all cooked and eaten that very eveningno more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew theinferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor whohad visited that very island and he told me that it was the customwhen a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain inthe yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they wereplaced in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilauwith breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouthswere sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends justas though these presents were so many christmas turkeysafter all i do not think that my remarks about religion made muchimpression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehowseemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless consideredfrom his own point of view and in the second place he did not morethan one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would andfinally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the truereligion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescendingconcern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that sucha sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical paganpietyat last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously heartybreakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should notmake much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board thepequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut boneschapter 18 his markas we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequegcarrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed usfrom his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibaland furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board thatcraft unless they previously produced their paperswhat do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on thebulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharfi mean he replied he must show his papersyes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head frombehind pelegs out of the wigwam he must show that hes convertedson of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at presentin communion with any christian churchwhy said i hes a member of the first congregational church herebe it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships atlast come to be converted into the churchesfirst congregational church cried bildad what that worships indeacon deuteronomy colemans meetinghouse and so saying taking outhis spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandanahandkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of thewigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look atqueequeghow long hath he been a member he then said turning to me notvery long i rather guess young manno said peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or itwould have washed some of that devils blue off his facedo tell now

a whaleboat did you ever strike afishwithout saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped uponthe bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboatshanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising hisharpoon cried out in some such way as thiscapain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him wellspose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it hedarted the iron right over old bildads broad brim clean across theships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sightnow said queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee him whaleeeye why

and to my great joy queequeg was soonenrolled among the same ships company to which i myself belongedwhen all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready forsigning he turned to me and said i guess quohog there dont knowhow to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy nameor make thy markbut at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before takenpart in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking theoffered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exactcounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm sothat through captain pelegs obstinate mistake touching hisappellative it stood something like thisquohog his x markmeanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequegand at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of hisbroadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting oneentitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it inqueequegs hands and then grasping them and the book with both hislooked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must domy duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned forthe souls of all its crew if thou

somesailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist now and then hestooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine whichotherwise might have been wastedchapter 19 the prophetshipmates have ye shipped in that shipqueequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away fromthe water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when theabove words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before uslevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was butshabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of ablack handkerchief investing his neck a confluent smallpox had in alldirections flowed over his face and left it like the complicatedribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried uphave ye shipped in her he repeatedyou mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a littlemore time for an uninterrupted look at himaye the pequodthat ship there he said drawing back his whole armand then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixedbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the objectyes said i we have just signed the articlesanything down there about your soulsabout whatoh

good whalehunter and a good captain to his crewthats true thats trueyes both true enough but you must jump whenhe gives an order step and growl growl and gothats the word withcaptain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him offcape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nightsnothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altarin santaheard nothing about that eh nothing about the silvercalabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg lastvoyage according to the prophecy didnt ye hear a word about themmatters and something more eh no i dont think ye did how could yewho knows it not all nantucket i guess but howsever mayhap yeveheard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard ofthat i dare say oh yes that every one knows amosti mean theyknow hes only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other offmy friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about idont know and i dont much care for it seems to me that you

for himthe likes of ye morning to ye shipmatesmorning oh when ye get there tell em ive concluded not to make oneof emah my dear fellow you cant fool us that wayyou cant fool us itis the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had agreat secret in himmorning to ye shipmates morningmorning it is said i come along queequeg lets leave this crazyman but stop tell me your name will youelijahelijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after eachothers fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he wasnothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not goneperhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner andlooking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following usthough at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that isaid nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with mycomrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same cornerthat we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging usbut with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine thiscircumstance coupled with his ambiguous halfhinting halfrevealingshrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wondermentsand halfapprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captainahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silvercalabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the shipthe day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and thevoyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowythingsi was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was reallydogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequegand on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed onwithout seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more andfinally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbugchapter 20 all astira day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequodnot only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming onboard and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everythingbetokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a closecaptain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwamkeeping a sharp lookout upon the hands bildad did all the purchasingand providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and onthe rigging were working till long after nightfallon the day following queequegs signing the articles word was given atall the inns where the ships company were stopping that their chestsmust be on board before night for there was no telling how soon thevessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our trapsresolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems theyalways give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sailfor several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done andthere is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequodwas fully equippedevery one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds saucepans knives andforks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not areindispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whalingwhich necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wide ocean farfrom all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers andthough this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any meansto the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length ofthe whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecutionof the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remoteharbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all shipswhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds andespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon whichthe success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats sparespars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost buta spare captain and duplicate shipat the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of thepequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread waterfuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some timethere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds andends of things both large and smallchief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captainbildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigablespirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if shecould help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod afteronce fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with ajar of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch ofquills for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third timewith a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic backnever did any woman better deserve her name which was charityauntcharity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did thischaritable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turnher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfortand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brotherbildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two ofwellsaved dollarsbut it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming onboard as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand anda still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself norcaptain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with hima long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival downwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in awhile peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the mendown the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead andthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwamduring these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited thecraft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was andwhen he was going to come on board his ship to these questions theywould answer that he was getting better and better and was expectedaboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad couldattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if ihad been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainlyin my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to solong a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be theabsolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the opensea but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if hebe already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover uphis suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me isaid nothing and tried to think nothingat last it was given out that some time next day the ship wouldcertainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very earlystartchapter 21 going aboardit was nearly six oclock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when wedrew nigh the wharfthere are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i toqueequeg it cant be shadows shes off by sunrise i guess comeonavast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming closebehind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuatinghimself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertaintwilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijahgoing aboardhands off will you said ilookee here said queequeg shaking himself go wayaint going aboard thenyes we are said i but what business is that of yours do youknow mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinentno no no i wasnt aware of that said elijah slowly andwonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountableglanceselijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing weare going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to bedetainedye be be ye coming back afore breakfasthes cracked queequeg said i come onholloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a fewpacesnever mind him said i queequeg come onbut he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on myshoulder saiddid ye see anything looking like men going towards thatship a while agostruck by this plain matteroffact question i answered saying yesi thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be surevery dim very dim said elijah morning to yeonce more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us andtouching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now willyefind whomorning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh iwas going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindits all oneall in the family toosharp frost this morning aint it goodbye toye shant see ye again very soon i guess unless its before thegrand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leavingme for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudenceat last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profoundquiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within thehatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forwardto the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing alight we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in atattered peajacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests hisface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumberslept upon himthose sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said ilooking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on thewharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence iwould have thought myself to have

best sit up with the body telling him toestablish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleepers rearas though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more adosat quietly down theregracious queequeg dont sit there said ioh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way wont hurt himfaceface said i call that his face very benevolent countenance thenbut how hard he breathes hes

the sleeper andlighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passingover the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioninghim in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in hisland owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the kingchiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fatteningsome of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a housecomfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazyfellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves besides it wasvery convenient on an excursion much better than those gardenchairswhich are convertible into walkingsticks upon occasion a chiefcalling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himselfunder a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy placewhile narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawkfrom me he flourished the hatchetside of it over the sleepers headwhats that for queequegperry easy kille oh perry easyhe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipewhich it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothedhis soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger thestrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began totell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemedtroubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up andrubbed his eyesholloa he breathed at last who be ye smokersshipped men answered i when does she sailaye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails today the captaincame aboard last nightwhat captainahabwho but him indeedi was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when weheard a noise on deckholloa starbucks astir said the rigger hes a lively chief matethat good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and sosaying he went on deck and we followedit was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos andthrees the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were activelyengaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing variouslast things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisiblyenshrined within his cabinchapter 22 merry christmasat length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the shipsriggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf andafter the everthoughtful charity had come off in a whaleboat withher last gifta nightcap for stubb the second mate herbrotherinlaw and a spare bible for the stewardafter all this thetwo captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning tothe chief mate peleg saidnow mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab isall readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shore ehwell call all hands then muster em aft hereblast emno need of profane words however great the hurry peleg saidbildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our biddinghow now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captainpeleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on thequarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at sea aswell as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no signof him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin butthen the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary ingetting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeedas that was not at all his proper business but the pilots and as hewas not yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore captain ahabstayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in themerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for aconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over thecabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friendsbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilotbut there was not much chance to think over the matter for captainpeleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking andcommanding and not bildadaft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered atthe mainmast mr starbuck drive em aftstrike the tent therewas the next order as i hinted before thiswhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board thepequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well knownto be the next thing to heaving up the anchorman the capstan blood and thunderjumpwas the next command andthe crew sprang for the handspikesnow in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilotis the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg beit known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensedpilots of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilotin order to save the nantucket pilotfee to all the ships he wasconcerned in for he never piloted any other craftbildad i say mightnow be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for theapproaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal staveof psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth somesort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty goodwill nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them thatno profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly ingetting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choicecopy of watts in each seamans berthmeantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg rippedand swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought hewould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily ipaused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking ofthe perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil fora pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that inpious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundredand seventyseventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rearand turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg inthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was myfirst kickis that the way they heave in the marchant service he roaredspring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone why dont yespring i say all of yespring quohog spring thou chap with the redwhiskers spring there scotchcap spring thou green pants spring isay all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he movedalong the windlass here and there using his leg very freely whileimperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks icaptain peleg must have been drinking something todayat last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided itwas a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged intonight we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whosefreezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows ofteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the whiteivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended fromthe bowslank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon asthe old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shiveringfrost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang hissteady notes were heardsweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand

winter night inthe boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket therewas yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store andmeads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by thespring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummerat last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed nolonger the stout sailboat that had accompanied us began rangingalongsideit was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affectedat this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yetvery loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous avoyagebeyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of hishard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmatesailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting toencounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say goodbye toa thing so every way brimful of every interest to himpoor old bildadlingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into thecabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck andlooked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters onlybounded by the faroff unseen eastern continents looked towards theland looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere andnowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pinconvulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lanternfor a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to saynevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i canas for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for allhis philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lanterncame too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to decknowa word below and now a word with starbuck the chief matebut

fairly embarked in this business of whalingand as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded amonglandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore iam all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice herebydone to us hunters of whalesin the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establishthe fact that among people at large the business of whaling is notaccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if astranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan societyit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits werehe presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulationof the naval officers he should append the initials swf sperm whalefishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemedpreeminently presuming and ridiculousdoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring uswhalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to abutchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein weare surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that istrue but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have beenall martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor andas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business yeshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generallyunknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the spermwhaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth buteven granting the charge in question to be true what disorderedslippery decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakablecarrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return todrink in all ladies plaudits and if the idea of peril so muchenhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assureye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery wouldquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tailfanning into eddies the air over his head for what are thecomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors andwonders of godbut though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does itunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allaboundingadoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burnround the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glorybut look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts ofscales see what we whalemen are and have beenwhy did the dutch in de witts time have admirals of their whalingfleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fitout whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town somescore or two of families from our own island of nantucket why didbritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bountiesupwards of 1000000 and lastly how comes it that we whalemen ofamerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the worldsail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteenthousand men yearly consuming 4000000 of dollars the ships worthat the time of sailing 20000000 and every year importing into ourharbors a well reaped harvest of 7000000 how comes all this ifthere be not something puissant in whalingbut this is not the half look againi freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his lifepoint out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixtyyears has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world takenin one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one wayand another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and socontinuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling maywell be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselvespregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task tocatalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years pastthe whaleship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest andleast known parts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoeswhich had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed ifamerican and european menofwar now peacefully ride in once savageharbors let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of thewhaleship which originally showed them the way and first interpretedbetween them and the savages they may celebrate as they will theheroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but isay that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucketthat were as great and greater than your cook and your krusensternfor in their succourless emptyhandedness they in the heathenishsharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islandsbattled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marinesand muskets would not willingly have dared all that is made such aflourish of in the old south sea voyages those things were but thelifetime commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers often adventureswhich vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accountedunworthy of being set down in the ships common log ah the world ohthe worlduntil the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonialscarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europeand the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacificcoast it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policyof the spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permittedit might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuatedthe liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spainand the establishment of the eternal democracy in those partsthat great america on the other side of the sphere australia wasgiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its firstblunderborn discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunnedthose shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touchedthere the whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colonymoreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement theemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolentbiscuit of the whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their watersthe uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and docommercial homage to the whaleship that cleared the way for themissionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitivemissionaries to their first destinations if that doublebolted landjapan is ever to become hospitable it is the whaleship alone to whomthe credit will be due for already she is on the thresholdbut if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has noæsthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready toshiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmetevery timethe whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler youwill saythe whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler whowrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and whocomposed the first narrative of a whalingvoyage who but no less aprince than alfred the great who with his own royal pen took downthe words from other the norwegian whalehunter of those times andwho pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burketrue enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have nogood blood in their veinsno good

unreasonablyambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole aman might rather have done than to have left undone if at my deathmy executors or more properly my creditors find any precious mss inmy desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the gloryto whaling for a whaleship was my yale college and my harvardchapter 25 postscriptin behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught butsubstantiated facts but after embattling his facts an advocate whoshould wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might telleloquently upon his causesuch an advocate would he not beblameworthyit is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens evenmodern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for theirfunctions is gone through there is a saltcellar of state so calledand there may be a castor of state how they use the saltpreciselywho knows certain i am however that a kings head issolemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad can it bethough that they anoint it with a view of making its interior runwell as they anoint machinery much might be ruminated hereconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process because incommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anointshis hair and palpably smells of that anointing in truth a mature manwho uses hairoil unless medicinally that man has probably got aquoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule he cant amount tomuch in his totalitybut the only thing to be considered here is thiswhat kind of oil isused at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassaroil nor castor oil nor bears oil nor train oil nor codliver oilwhat then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufacturedunpolluted state the sweetest of all oilsthink of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kings andqueens with coronation stuffchapter 26 knights and squiresthe chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and aquaker by descent he was a long earnest man and though born on anicy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh beinghard as twicebaked biscuit transported to the indies his live bloodwould not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some timeof general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for whichhis state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen thosesummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this histhinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxietiesand cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it wasmerely the condensation of the man he was by no means illlookingquite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit andclosely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strengthlike a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure forlong ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snowor torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality waswarranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemedto see there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils hehad calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose lifefor the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tamechapter of sounds yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude therewere certain qualities in him which at times affected and in somecases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonlyconscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverencethe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly inclinehim to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in someorganizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence thanfrom ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his andif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much moredid his faraway domestic memories of his young cape wife and childtend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his natureand open him still further to those latent influences which in somehonesthearted men restrain the gush of daredevil daring so oftenevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery iwill have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of awhale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable anduseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of theencountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far moredangerous comrade than a cowardaye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is ascareful a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery but we shallere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by aman like stubb or almost any other whale hunterstarbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not asentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand uponall mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that inthis business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfitsof the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishlywasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales aftersundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persistedin fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this criticalocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them fortheirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knewwhat doom was his own fathers where in the bottomless deeps couldhe find the torn limbs of his brotherwith memories like these in him and moreover given to a certainsuperstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck whichcould nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme butit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with suchterrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in naturethat these things should fail in latently engendering an element inhim which under suitable circumstances would break out from itsconfinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be itwas that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men whichwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds orwhales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yetcannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrorswhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enragedand mighty manbut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the completeabasement of poor starbucks fortitude scarce might i have the heartto write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to exposethe fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as jointstockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may bemen may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so nobleand so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over anyignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw theircostliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves sofar within us that it remains intact though all the outer characterseem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of avalorruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sightcompletely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars butthis august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robesbut that abounding dignity which has no robed

called a capecodman a happygoluckyneither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with anindifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of thechase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engagedfor the year goodhumored easy and careless he presided over hiswhaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and hiscrew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortablearrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is aboutthe snugness of his box when close to the whale in the verydeathlock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly andoffhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over hisold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperatedmonster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of deathinto an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is notelling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a questionbut if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after acomfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be asort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves thereabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order andnot soonerwhat perhaps with other things made stubb such an easygoingunfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in aworld full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packswhat helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor of his thatthing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short blacklittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face you wouldalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without hisnose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there readyloaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and wheneverhe turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one fromthe other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be inreadiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting hislegs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouthi say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of hispeculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly airwhether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the namelessmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as intime of the cholera some people go about with a camphoratedhandkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortaltribulations stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort ofdisinfecting agentthe third mate was flask a native of tisbury in marthas vineyard ashort stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whaleswho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personallyand hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point ofhonor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lostwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majesticbulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension ofany possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinionthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at leastwaterrat requiring only a little circumvention and some smallapplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil thisignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish inthe matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and athree years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lastedthat length of time as a carpenters nails are divided into wroughtnails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flaskwas one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long theycalled him kingpost on board of the pequod because in form he couldbe well likened to the short square timber known by that name inarctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbersinserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussionsof those battering seasnow these three matesstarbuck stubb and flask were momentous menthey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of thepequods boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in whichcaptain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on thewhales these three headsmen were as captains of companies or beingarmed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trioof lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelinsand since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothicknight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer or harpooneerwho in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when theformer one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault andmoreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacyand friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we setdown who the pequods harpooneers were and to what headsman each ofthem belongedfirst of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selectedfor his squire but queequeg is already knownnext was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerlypromontory of marthas vineyard where there still exists the lastremnant of a village of red men which has long supplied theneighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daringharpooneers in the fishery they usually go by the generic name ofgayheaders tashtegos long lean sable hair his high cheek bonesand black rounding eyesfor an indian oriental in their largeness butantarctic in their glittering expressionall this sufficientlyproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proudwarrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose hadscoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longersnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego nowhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoonof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires to lookat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost havecredited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans andhalfbelieved this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powersof the air tashtego was stubb

relieved each other at thewatches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemedto be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued fromthe cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it wasplain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord anddictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted topenetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabinevery time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantlygazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vaguedisquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of thesea became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened attimes by the ragged elijahs diabolical incoherences uninvitedlyrecurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceivedof but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i wasalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandishprophet of the wharves but whatever it was of apprehensiveness oruneasinessto call it sowhich i felt yet whenever i came to lookabout me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish suchemotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crewwere a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of thetame merchantship companies which my previous experiences had made meacquainted with still i ascribed thisand rightly ascribed itto thefierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocationin which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially theaspect of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which wasmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings andinduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyagethree better more likely seaofficers and men each in his owndifferent way could not readily be found and they were every one ofthem americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it beingchristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we hadbiting polar weather though all the time running away from it to thesouthward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailedgradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerableweather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still greyand gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind theship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leapingand melancholy rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call ofthe forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards thetaffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehensioncaptain ahab stood upon his quarterdeckthere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of therecovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake whenthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming themor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness hiswhole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in anunalterable mould like cellinis cast perseus threading its way outfrom among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of histawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing yousaw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish it resembled thatperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of agreat tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it andwithout wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark fromtop to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree stillgreenly alive but branded whether that mark was born with him orwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one couldcertainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little orno allusion was made to it especially by the mates but oncetashtegos senior an old gayhead indian among the crewsuperstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old didahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in thefury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet thiswild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxmaninsinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed outof nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab neverthelessthe old seatraditions the immemorial credulities popularly investedthis old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that nowhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if evercaptain ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come topass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for thedead would find a birthmark on him from crown to soleso powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and thelivid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments i hardlynoted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to thebarbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously cometo me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polishedbone of the sperm whales jaw aye he was dismasted off japan saidthe old gayhead indian once but like his dismasted craft he shippedanother mast without coming home for it he has a quiver of emi was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side ofthe pequods quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shroudsthere was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into theplank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated andholding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight outbeyond the ships everpitching prow there was an infinity of firmestfortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed andfearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nordid his officers say aught to him though by all their minutestgestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if notpainful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye and notonly that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixionin his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of somemighty woeere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabinbut after that morning he was every day visible to the crew eitherstanding in his pivothole or seated upon an ivory stool he had orheavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began togrow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as ifwhen the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintrybleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by itcame to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yetfor all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck heseemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was onlymaking a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whalingpreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to sothat there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or exciteahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds thatlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choosethe loftiest peaks to pile themselves uponnevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of thepleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm himfrom his mood for as when the redcheeked dancing girls april andmay trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barestruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth somefew green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so ahab didin the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlishair more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a lookwhich in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smilechapter 29 enter ahab to him stubbsome days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now wentrolling through

lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship fromtaffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from belowwith a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that ifcaptain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could saynay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hintingsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and theinsertion into it of the ivory

not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than halflike it siravast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving awayas if to avoid some passionate temptationno sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely becalled a dog sirthen be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begoneor ill clear the world of theeas he said this ahab advanced upon him with such

queer stop stubb somehow now i dont well know whether to goback and strike him orwhats thatdown here on my knees and pray forhim yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be thefirst time i ever did pray its queer very queer and hes queertoo aye take him fore and aft hes about the queerest old man stubbever sailed with how he flashed at mehis eyes like powderpans ishe mad anyway theres something on his mind as sure as there must besomething on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now eithermore than three hours out of the twentyfour and he dont sleep thendidnt that doughboy the steward tell me that of a morning he alwaysfinds the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and thesheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots andthe pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been onit a hot old man i guess hes got what some folks ashore call aconscience its a kind of ticdollyrow they sayworse nor atoothache well well i dont know what it is but the lord keep mefrom catching it hes full of riddles i wonder what he goes into theafter hold for every night as doughboy tells me he suspects whatsthat for i should like to know whos made appointments with him inthe hold aint that queer now but theres no telling its the oldgamehere goes for a snooze damn me its worth a fellows while to beborn into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i thinkof it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort ofqueer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of embut thats against my principles think not is my eleventhcommandment and sleep when you can is my twelfthso here goes againbut hows that didnt he call me a dog blazes he called me ten timesa donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that he might aswell have kicked me and done with it maybe he did kick me and ididnt observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow itflashed like a bleached bone what the devils the matter with me idont stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sortof turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreamingthoughhow how howbut the only ways to stash it so here goes tohammock again and in the morning ill see how this plaguey jugglingthinks over by daylightchapter 30 the pipewhen stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over thebulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling asailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and alsohis pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stoolon the weather side of the deck he sat and smokedin old norse times the thrones of the sealoving danish kings werefabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how couldone look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones withoutbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plankand a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahabsome moments passed during which the thick vapor came from his mouthin quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face hownow he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking nolonger soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy

paced the plankschapter 31 queen mabnext morning stubb accosted flasksuch a queer dream kingpost i never had you know the old mansivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried tokick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off andthen presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool keptkicking at it but what was still more curious flaskyou know howcurious all dreams arethrough all this rage that i was in i somehowseemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of aninsult that kick from ahab why thinks i whats the row its nota real leg only a false leg and theres a mighty difference betweena living thump and a dead thump thats what makes a blow from thehand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a canethe living memberthat makes the living insult my little man andthinks i to myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my sillytoes against that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was itall all the while i say i was thinking to myself whats his legnow but a canea whalebone cane yes thinks i it was only aplayful cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot abase kick besides thinks i look at it once why the end of itthefoot partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footedfarmer kicked me theres a devilish broad insult but this insult iswhittled down to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of thedream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort ofbadgerhaired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by theshoulders and slews me round what are you bout says he slidman but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i wasover the fright what am i about says i at last and what businessis that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want akick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turnedround his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed hehad for a cloutwhat do you think i sawwhy thunder alive man hisstern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i onsecond thoughts i guess i wont kick you old fellow wise stubbsaid he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort ofeating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasnt going tostop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might aswell fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted myfoot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa says iwhats the matter now old fellow look ye here says he letsargue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didnt he yes he didsays iright here it was very good says hehe used his ivoryleg didnt he yes he did says i well then says he wisestubb what have you to complain of didnt he kick with right goodwill it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no youwere kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb itsan honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old englandthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen andmade garterknights of but be your boast stubb that ye werekicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say bekicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick backfor you cant help yourself wise stubb dont you see that pyramidwith that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion toswim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i was in myhammock now what do you think of that dream flaski dont know it seems a sort of foolish to me thomay be may be but its made a wise man of me flask dye see ahabstanding there sideways looking over the stern well the best thingyou can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to himwhatever he says halloa whats that he shouts harkmasthead there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereaboutsif ye see a white one split your lungs for himwhat do you think of that now flask aint there a small drop ofsomething queer about that eh a white whaledid ye mark that manlook yetheres something special in the wind stand by for it flaskahab has that thats bloody on his mind but mum he comes this waychapter 32 cetologyalready we are boldly launched upon the deep but

best and latest authorities have laid downno branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitledcetology says captain scoresby ad 1820it is not my intention were it in my power to enter

separatesubject of the greenland or rightwhale he is the best existingauthority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the greatsperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthymentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurperupon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest ofthe whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and theprofound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested thethen fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance tothis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreatsand whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete referenceto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of pastdays will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival wasto them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last come for anew proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people allthegreenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneththere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put theliving sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotestdegree succeed in the attempt those books are beales and bennettsboth in their time surgeons to english southsea whaleships and bothexact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale tobe found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goesit is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientificdescription as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poeticlives not complete in any literature far above all other huntedwhales his is an unwritten lifenow the various species of whales need some sort of popularcomprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for thepresent hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequentlaborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand ihereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing completebecause any human thing supposed to be complete must for that veryreason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomicaldescription of the various species orin this place at leastto muchof any description my object here is simply to project the draught ofa systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builderbut it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in thepostoffice is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the seaafter them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundationsribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am ithat i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awfultauntings in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make acovenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swamthrough libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do withwhales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try thereare some preliminaries to settlefirst the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetologyis in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters itstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system ofnature ad 1776 linnæus declares i hereby separate the whales fromthe fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850sharks and shad alewives and herring against linnæuss express edictwere still found dividing the possession of the same seas with theleviathanthe grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished the whales fromthe waters he states as follows on account of their warm bilocularheart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penemintrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturæ juremeritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charleycoffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage andthey united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogetherinsufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbugbe it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashionedground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back methis fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internalrespect does the whale differ from other fish above linnæus has givenyou those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm bloodwhereas all other fish are lungless and cold bloodednext how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so asconspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then awhale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail there you have himhowever contracted that definition is the result of expandedmeditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not afish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition isstill more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must havenoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but avertical or upanddown tail whereas among spouting fish the tailthough it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontalpositionby the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means excludefrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identifiedwith the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the otherhand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded asalien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fishmust be included in this groundplan of cetology now then come thegrand divisions of the entire whale hosti am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins anddugongs pigfish and sowfish of the coffins of nantucket areincluded by many naturalists among the whales but as these pigfishare a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of riversand feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i denytheir credentials as whales and have presented them with theirpassports to quit the kingdom of cetologyfirst according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primarybooks subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend themall both small and largei the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whaleas the type of the folio i present the sperm whale of the octavothe grampus of the duodecimo the porpoisefolios among these i here include the following chaptersi thesperm whale ii the right whale iii the finback whale ivthe humpbacked whale v the razor back whale vi the sulphurbottom whalebook i folio chapter i sperm whalethis whale among theenglish of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale and the physeterwhale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of thefrench and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of thelong words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globethe most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic inaspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being theonly creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti isobtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlargedupon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologicallyconsidered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale wasalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oilwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those daysspermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from acreature identical with the one then known in england as the greenlandor right whale it was the idea also that this same spermaceti wasthat quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllableof the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti wasexceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointmentand medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as younowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course oftime the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name wasstill retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by anotion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellationmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which thisspermaceti was really derivedbook i folio chapter ii right whalein one respect this isthe most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularlyhunted by man it yields the article commonly known as whalebone orbaleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior articlein commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated byall the following titles the whale the greenland whale the blackwhale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is adeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thusmultitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include inthe second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of theenglish naturalists the greenland whale of the english whalemen thebaleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of theswedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has beenhunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whalewhich the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean onthe brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other parts ofthe world designated by them right whale cruising groundssome pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of theenglish and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agreein all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a singledeterminate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is byendless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences thatsome departments of natural history become so repellingly intricatethe right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length withreference to elucidating the sperm whalebook i folio chapter iii finbackunder this head i reckona monster which by the various names of finback tallspout andlongjohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whalewhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing theatlantic in the new york packettracks in the length he attains andin his baleen the finback resembles the right whale but is of a lessportly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his greatlips present a cablelike aspect formed by the intertwisting slantingfolds of large wrinkles his grand distinguishing feature the finfrom which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this finis some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinderpart of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointedend even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visiblethis isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from thesurface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked withspherical ripples and this gnomonlike fin stands up and casts shadowsupon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the waterycircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style andwavy hourlines graved on it on that ahazdial the shadow often goesback the finback is not gregarious he seems a whalehater as somemen are manhaters very shy always going solitary unexpectedlyrising to the surface in the

with the right whale among a theoreticspecies denominated whalebone whales that is whales with baleen ofthese so called whalebone whales there would seem to be severalvarieties most of which however are little known broadnosed whalesand beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched whales underjawedwhales and rostrated whales are the fishermens names for a few sortsin connection with this appellative of whalebone whales it is ofgreat importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may beconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it isin vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan foundedupon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding thatthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted toafford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any otherdetached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presentshow then the baleen hump backfin and teeth these are things whosepeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whaleswithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure inother and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale and thehumpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceasesthen this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of thesehas baleen but there again the similitude ceases and it is just thesame with the other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whalesthey form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one ofthem detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy allgeneral methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every oneof the whalenaturalists has splitbut it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of thewhale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit theright classification nay what thing for example is there in thegreenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we haveseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify thegreenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the variousleviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part asavailable to the systematizer as those external ones alreadyenumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whalesbodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that wayand this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the onlyone that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceedbook i folio chapter iv hump backthis whale is often seenon the northern american coast he has been frequently captured thereand towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler oryou might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate thepopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since thesperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not veryvaluable he has baleen he is the most gamesome and lighthearted ofall the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than anyother of thembook i folio chapter v razor backof this whale little isknown but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of aretiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though nocoward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back whichrises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nordoes anybody elsebook i folio chapter vi sulphur bottomanother retiringgentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along thetartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seenat least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas andthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance he isnever chased he would run away with ropewalks of line prodigies aretold of him adieu

whichpresent may be numberedi the grampus ii the black fishiii the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killerwhy this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plainbecause while the whales of this order though smaller than those ofthe former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to themin figure yet the bookbinders quarto volume in its dimensioned formdoes not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volumedoesbook ii octavo chapter i grampusthough this fish whoseloud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb tolandsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he notpopularly classed among whales but possessing all the granddistinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognisedhim for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen totwentyfive feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round thewaist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oilis considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by somefishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of thegreat sperm whalebook ii octavo chapter ii black fishi give the popularfishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the bestwhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so andsuggest another i do so now touching the black fish socalledbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales so call him thehyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from thecircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards hecarries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whaleaverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almostall latitudes he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked finin swimming which looks something like a roman nose when not moreprofitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture thehyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domesticemploymentas some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company andquite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous waxthough their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield youupwards of thirty gallons of oilbook ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostrilwhaleanother instance of a curiously named whale so named i supposefrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose thecreature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages fivefeet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictlyspeaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jawin a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only foundon the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its ownersomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy lefthanded man whatprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard tosay it does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish andbillfish though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it fora rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffinsaid it was used for an icepiercer for the narwhale rising to thesurface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts hishorn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of thesesurmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this onesidedhorn may really be used by the narwhalehowever that may beit wouldcertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphletsthe narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whaleand the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of theunicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature fromcertain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this sameseaunicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidoteagainst poison and as such preparations of it brought immense pricesit was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the sameway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshornoriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosityblack letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from thatvoyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to himfrom a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down thethames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith blackletter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious longhorn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castleat windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester onbended knees did likewise present to her highness another hornpertaining to a land beast of the unicorn naturethe narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of amilkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of blackhis oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of itand he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seasbook ii octavo chapter iv killerof this whale little isprecisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professednaturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should saythat he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very savagea sort offeegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip andhangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to deaththe killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he hasexception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on theground of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and onsea bonapartes and sharks includedbook ii octavo chapter v thrasherthis gentleman is famousfor his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes hemounts the folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage byflogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similarprocess still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer bothare outlaws even in the lawless seas thus ends book ii octavo and begins book iii duodecimoduodecimoesthese include the smaller whales i the huzza porpoiseii the algerine porpoise iii the mealymouthed porpoiseto those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it maypossibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or fivefeet should be marshalled among whalesa word which in the popularsense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set downabove as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of mydefinition of what a whale isie a spouting fish with a horizontaltailbook iii duodecimo chapter 1 huzza porpoisethis is thecommon porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my ownbestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and somethingmust be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he alwaysswims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossingthemselves to heaven like caps in a fourthofjuly crowd theirappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full offine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windwardthey are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounteda lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholdingthese vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godlygamesomeness is not in ye a wellfed plump huzza porpoise will yieldyou one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluidextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request amongjewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meatis good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that aporpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not veryreadily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch himand you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniaturebook iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoisea piratevery savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhatlarger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general makeprovoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him manytimes but never yet saw him capturedbook iii duodecimo chapter iii mealymouthed porpoisethelargest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as itis known the only english name by which he has hitherto beendesignated is that of the fishersrightwhale porpoise from thecircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio inshape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of aless rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat andgentlemanlike figure he has no fins on his back most other porpoiseshave he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazelhue but his mealymouth spoils all though his entire back down to hisside fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the markin a ships hull called the bright waist that line streaks him fromstem to stern with two separate colours black above and white belowthe white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth whichmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to amealbag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that ofthe common porpoise       beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as theporpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all theleviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitivehalffabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know byreputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by theirforecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable tofuture investigators who may complete what i have here but begun ifany of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked thenhe can readily be incorporated into this system according to hisfolio octavo or duodecimo magnitudethe bottlenose whale the junkwhale the puddingheaded whale the cape whale the leading whale thecannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whalethe iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandicdutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other listsof uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but iomit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting themfor mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothingfinally it was stated at the outset that this system would not behere and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i havekept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thusunfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with thecrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for smallerections may be finished by their first architects grand ones trueones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from evercompleting anything this whole book is but a draughtnay but thedraught of a draught oh time strength cash and patiencechapter 33 the specksnyderconcerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a placeas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arisingfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknownof course in any other marine than the whalefleetthe large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evincedby the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuriesand more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in theperson now called the captain but was divided between him and anofficer called the specksnyder literally this word means fatcutterusage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer inthose days the captains authority was restricted to the navigationand general management of the vessel while over the whalehuntingdepartment and all its concerns the specksnyder or chief harpooneerreigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corruptedtitle of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained buthis former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply assenior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captains moreinferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of theharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and sincein the american fishery he is not only an important officer in theboat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whalingground the command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grandpolitical maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apartfrom the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as theirprofessional superior though always by them familiarly regarded astheir social equalnow the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea isthisthe first lives aft the last forward hence in whaleships andmerchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain andso too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged inthe after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals inthe captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating withitthough the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longestof all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it andthe community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom highor low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon theircommon luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity andhard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget aless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mindhow much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in someprimitive instances live together for all that the punctiliousexternals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxedand in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships inwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elatedgrandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost asmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not theshabbiest of pilotclothand though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the leastgiven to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homagehe ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though herequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon thequarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiarcircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed headdressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or interrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no meansunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the seanor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behindthose forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himselfincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends thanthey were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism ofhis brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifestedthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in anirresistible dictatorship for be a mans intellectual superiority whatit will it can never assume the practical available supremacy overother men without the aid of some sort of external arts andentrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and basethis it is that for ever keeps gods true princes of the empire fromthe worlds hustings and leaves the highest honors that this air cangive to those men who become famous more through their infiniteinferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert thanthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the masssuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme politicalsuperstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiotimbecility they have imparted potency but when as in the case ofnicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles animperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before thetremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who woulddepict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swingever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the onenow alluded tobut ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucketgrimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors andkings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor oldwhalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappingsand housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee itmust needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep andfeatured in the unbodied airchapter 34 the cabintableit is noon and doughboy the steward thrusting his paleloafofbread face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to his lordand master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just been takingan observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude onthe smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose onthe upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to thetidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial butpresently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to thedeck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mrstarbuck disappears into the cabinwhen the last echo of his sultans step has died away and starbuckthe first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated thenstarbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planksand after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch ofpleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the secondemir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking themain brace to see whether it will be all right with that importantrope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinnermr flask follows after his predecessorsbut the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeckseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping allsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off hisshoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe rightover the grand turks head and then by a dexterous sleight pitchinghis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking sofar at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all otherprocessions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping intothe cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether andthen independent hilarious little flask enters king ahabs presencein the character of abjectus or the slaveit is not the least among the strange things bred by the intenseartificialness of seausages that while in the open air of the decksome officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly anddefyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let thosevery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in thatsame commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to saydeprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of thetable this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore thisdifference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king ofbabylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteouslytherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but hewho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his ownprivate dinnertable of invited guests that mans unchallenged powerand dominion of individual influence for the time that mans royaltyof state transcends belshazzars for belshazzar was not the greatestwho has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be cæsarit is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstandingnow if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of ashipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of thatpeculiarity of sealife just mentionedover his ivoryinlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sealionon the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but stilldeferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to beserved they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahabthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mindtheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carvedthe chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world theywould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation evenupon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out hisknife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahabthereby motioned starbucks plate towards him the mate received hismeat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a littlestarted if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewedit noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for likethe coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperorprofoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin mealswere somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table oldahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a reliefit was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the holdbelow and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boyof this weary family party his were the shinbones of the saline beefhis would have been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to helphimself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in thefirst degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless nevermore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest worldnevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flaskhelped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed itleast of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether hethought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of itsclotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on solong a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium andtherefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alaswas a butterless mananother thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flaskis the first man up consider for hereby flasks dinner was badlyjammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of himand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubbeven who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a smallappetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flaskmust bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls thatday for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to thedeck therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that eversince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment hehad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or lessfor what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortalin him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departedfrom my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit ofoldfashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was beforethe mast theres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity ofglory theres the insanity of life besides if it were so that anymere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flasksofficial capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain amplevengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at flaskthrough the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered beforeawful ahabnow ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first tablein the pequods cabin after their departure taking place in invertedorder to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather wasrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then thethree harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuarylegatees they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high andmighty cabinin strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and namelessinvisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefreelicense and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferiorfellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraidof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewedtheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it they dinedlike lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loadingwith spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego thatto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the paledoughboy was fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seeminglyquarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if hedid not go with a nimble hopskipandjump then tashtego had anungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his backharpoonwise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisteddoughboys memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his headinto a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in handbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he wasnaturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow thisbreadfaced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a

nominally livedthere still being anything but sedentary in their habits they werescarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleepingtimewhen they passed through it to their own peculiar quartersin this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whalecaptains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rightsthe ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone thatanybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truththe mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said tohave lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it itwas something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for amoment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thingresiding in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabinwas no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominallyincluded in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it helived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settledmissouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild loganof the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out thewinter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling oldage ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fedupon the sullen paws of its gloomchapter 35 the mastheadit was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with theother seamen my first masthead came roundin most american whalemen the mastheads are manned almostsimultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though she mayhave fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her propercruising ground and if after a three four or five years voyage sheis drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay an empty vialeventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till herskysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogetherrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale morenow as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is avery ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiatehere i take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the oldegyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to themfor though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless bytheir tower have intended to rear the loftiest masthead in all asiaor africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that greatstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in thedread gale of gods wrath therefore we cannot give these babelbuilders priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were anation of masthead standers is an assertion based upon the generalbelief among archæologists that the first pyramids were founded forastronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiarstairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby withprodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers werewont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as thelookouts of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearingin sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old timeswho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the wholelatter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from theground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of adauntless standerofmastheads who was not to be driven from hisplace by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facingeverything out to the last literally died at his post of modernstandersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone ironand bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff galeare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upondiscovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top ofthe column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred andfifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks belowwhether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil greatwashington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast inbaltimore and like one of hercules pillars his column marks thatpoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiralnelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his masthead intrafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoketoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there issmoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nornelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked tobefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gazehowever it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through thethick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must beshunnedit may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mastheadstanders of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is notso is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the solehistorian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells usthat in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularlylaunched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erectedlofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended bymeans of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhousea few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of newzealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymannedboats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn wethen to the one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea thethree mastheads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset the seamentaking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each otherevery two hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedinglypleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it isdelightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decksstriding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts whilebeneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest

closet ofyour watchcoatconcerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of asouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents orpulpits called crowsnests in which the lookouts of a greenlandwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas inthe fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among theicebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for therediscovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in thisadmirable volume all standers of mastheads are furnished with acharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently inventedcrowsnest of the glacier which was the name of captain sleetsgood craft he called it the sleets crowsnest in honor ofhimself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from allridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own childrenafter our own names we fathers being the original inventors andpatentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any otherapparatus we may beget in shape the sleets crowsnest is somethinglike a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it isfurnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your headin a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend intoit through a little traphatch in the bottom on the after side orside next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a lockerunderneath for umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leatherrack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope andother nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood hismasthead in this crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had arifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flaskand shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales orvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannotsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of thewater but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now itwas plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he doesall the little detailed conveniences of his crowsnest but though heso enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a veryscientific account of his experiments in this crowsnest with a smallcompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errorsresulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnaclemagnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron inthe ships planks and in the glaciers case perhaps to there havingbeen so many brokendown blacksmiths among her crew i say that thoughthe captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all hislearned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations andapproximate errors he knows very well captain sleet that he wasnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to failbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished littlecasebottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crows nest withineasy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire andeven love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take itvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that casebottleseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been whilewith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematicsaloft there in that birds nest within three or four perches of thepolebut if we southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft ascaptain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage isgreatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of thoseseductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i usedto lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have achat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find therethen ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over thetopsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and soat last mount to my ultimate destinationlet me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i keptbut sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me howcould ibeing left completely to myself at such a thoughtengenderingaltitudehow could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe allwhaleships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing outevery timeand let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners ofnantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad withlean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and whooffers to ship with the phædon instead of bowditch in his head bewareof such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can bekilled and this sunkeneyed young platonist will tow you ten wakesround the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer norare these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whalefisheryfurnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absentmindedyoung men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seekingsentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently percheshimself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleshipand in moody phrase ejaculatesroll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousandblubberhunters sweep over thee in vainvery often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded youngphilosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficientinterest in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lostto all honorable ambition as that in their secret souls they wouldrather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those youngplatonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they areshortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they haveleft their operaglasses at homewhy thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads weve beencruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whaleyet whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up hereperhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them inthe far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlike listlessness ofvacant unconscious reverie is this absentminded youth by the blendingcadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identitytakes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deepblue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strangehalfseen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him everydimlydiscovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to himthe embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul bycontinually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spiritebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and spacelike cranmers sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part ofevery shore the round globe overthere is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by agently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea fromthe inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is onye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and youridentity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover andperhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one halfthrottledshriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea nomore to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheistschapter 36 the quarterdeckenter ahab then allit was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morningshortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended thecabingangway to the deck there most seacaptains usually walk at thathour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns inthe gardensoon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his oldrounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all overdented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk didyou fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there alsoyou would see still stranger footprintsthe footprints of his oneunsleeping everpacing thoughtbut on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as hisnervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of histhought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at themainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thoughtturn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completelypossessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould ofevery outer movementdye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick thats in him pecksthe shell twill soon be outthe hours wore onahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing thedeck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspectit drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by thebulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there andwith one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybodyaftsir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given onshipboard except in some extraordinary casesend everybody aft repeated ahab mastheads there come downwhen the entire ships company were assembled and with curious and notwholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlikethe weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidlyglancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crewstarted from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh himresumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and halfslouchedhat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering amongthe men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must havesummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian featbut this did not last long vehemently pausing he criedwhat do ye do when ye see a whale mensing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbedvoicesgood cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing thehearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magneticallythrown themand what do ye next menlower away and after himand what tune is it ye pull to mena dead whale or a stove boatmore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew thecountenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began togaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that theythemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questionsbut they were all eagerness again as ahab now halfrevolving in hispivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightlyalmost convulsively grasping it addressed them thusall ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a whitewhale look ye dye see this spanish ounce of goldholding up abroad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piece men dyesee it mr starbuck hand me yon topmaulwhile the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking wasslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as ifto heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowlyhumming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled andinarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of hisvitality in himreceiving the topmaul from starbuck he advanced towards the mainmastwith the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with theother and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raisesme a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jawwhosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale with three holespunctured in his starboard flukelook ye whosoever of ye raises methat same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boyshuzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins theyhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mastits a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down thetopmaul a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp forwhite water if ye see but a bubble sing outall this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with evenmore intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention ofthe wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each wasseparately touched by some specific recollectioncaptain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same thatsome call moby dickmoby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tashdoes he fantail a little curious sir before he goes down said thegayheader deliberatelyand has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for aparmacetty and mighty quick captain ahaband he have one two threeoh good many iron in him hide toocaptain cried queequeg disjointedly all twisketee betwisk likehimhim faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round andround as though uncorking a bottlelike himhimcorkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twistedand wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a wholeshock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after thegreat annual sheepshearing aye tashtego and he fantails like asplit jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye haveseenmoby dickmoby dickcaptain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus farbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemedstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captainahab i have heard of moby dickbut it was not moby dick that took offthy legwho told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye myhearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick thatbrought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shoutedwith a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken mooseaye aye it was that accursed white whale that razed me made a poorpegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms withmeasureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and ill chase himround good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstromand round perditions flames before i give him up and this is what yehave shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of landand over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls finout what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye dolook braveaye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to theexcited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance formoby dickgod bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless yemen steward go draw the great measure of grog but whats this longface about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art notgame for moby dicki am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captainahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but icame here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeance how manybarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captainahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket marketnantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest alittle lower layer if moneys to be the measurer man and theaccountants have computed their great countinghouse the globe bygirdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch thenlet me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium herehe smites his chest whispered stubb whats that for methinks itrings most vast but hollowvengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote theefrom blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thingcaptain ahab seems blasphemoushark ye yet againthe little lower layer all visible objects manare but as pasteboard masks but in each eventin the living act theundoubted deedthere some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forththe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask if manwill strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reachoutside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale isthat wall shoved near to me sometimes i think theres naught beyondbut tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageousstrength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutablething is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be thewhite whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to meof blasphemy man id strike the sun if it insulted me for could thesun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort offair play

learned the history of that murderousmonster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths ofviolence and revengefor some time past though at intervals only the unaccompaniedsecluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostlyfrequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew ofhis existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seenhim while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly givenbattle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number ofwhalecruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entirewatery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their questalong solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonthor more on a stretch to encounter a single newstelling sail of anysort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularityof the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstancesdirect and indirect long obstructed the spread through the wholeworldwide whalingfleet of the special individualizing tidingsconcerning moby dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vesselsreported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such orsuch a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignitywhich whale after doing great mischief to his assailants hadcompletely escaped them to some minds it was not an unfairpresumption i say that the whale in question must have been no otherthan moby dick yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been markedby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning andmalice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who byaccident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhapsfor the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bredmore as it were to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at largethan to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrousencounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularlyregardedand as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chancecaught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every oneof them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for anyother whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensuein these assaultsnot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles brokenlimbs or devouring amputationsbut fatal to the last degree offatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating andpiling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shakethe fortitude of many brave hunters to whom the story of the whitewhale had eventually comenor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the morehorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only dofabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprisingterrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but inmaritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumorsabound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling toand as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fisherysurpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness andfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not onlyare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance andsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors theyare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever isappallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye itsgreatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in suchremotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed athousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone oraught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes andlongitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman iswrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with manya mighty birthno wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit overthe widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did inthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints andhalfformed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies whicheventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anythingthat visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finallystrike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the whitewhale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of hisjawbut there were still other and more vital practical influences at worknot even at the present day has the original prestige of the spermwhale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of theleviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there arethose this day among them who though intelligent and courageousenough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale wouldperhapseither from professional inexperience or incompetency ortimidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate thereare plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations notsailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encounteredthe sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan isrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the northseated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childishfireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southernwhaling nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm whaleanywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prowswhich stem himand as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendarytimes thrown its shadow before it we find some booknaturalistsolassen and povelsondeclaring the sperm whale not only tobe a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to beso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human bloodnor even down to so late a time as cuviers were these or almostsimilar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baronhimself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharksincluded are struck with the most lively terrors and often in theprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks withsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the generalexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these yet intheir full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson thesuperstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of theirvocation revived in the minds of the huntersso that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a fewof the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier daysof the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce longpractised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daringwarfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might behopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparitionas the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would beinevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there aresome remarkable documents that may be consultednevertheless some there were who even in the face of these thingswere ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number whochancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without thespecific details of any certain calamity and without superstitiousaccompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle ifofferedone of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linkedwith the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined wasthe unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he hadactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the sameinstant of timenor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceitaltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for asthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulgedeven to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the spermwhale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable tohis pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curiousand contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerningthe mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth hetransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distantpointsit is a thing well known to both american and english whaleships andas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresbythat some whales have been captured far north in the pacific in whosebodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenlandseas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it hasbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults couldnot have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has beenbelieved by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long aproblem to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in thereal living experience of living men the prodigies related in oldtimes of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top therewas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to thesurface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountainnear syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holyland by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almostfully equalled by the realities of the whalemenforced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these andknowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale hadescaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemenshould go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick notonly ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity intime that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks hewould still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made tospout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception foragain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsulliedjet would once more be seenbut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough inthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strikethe imagination with unwonted power for it was not so much hisuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whalesbut as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkledforehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominentfeatures the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas herevealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew himthe rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with thesame shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctiveappellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified byhis vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark bluesea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with goldengleamingsnor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet hisdeformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with naturalterror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according tospecific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaultsmore than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay thanperhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuerswith every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been knownto turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave theirboats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their shipalready several fatalities had attended his chase but though similardisasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual inthe fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whalesinfernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or deaththat he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by anunintelligent agentjudge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds ofhis more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewedboats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of thewhite curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperatingsunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridalhis three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in theeddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow haddashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindlyseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of thewhale that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweepinghis sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped awayahabs leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turkno hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seemingmalice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since thatalmost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictivenessagainst the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidnesshe at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes butall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swambefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those maliciousagencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are leftliving on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignitywhich has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modernchristians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient ophites ofthe east reverenced in their statue devilahab did not fall down andworship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to theabhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it allthat most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of thingsall truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes thebrain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazyahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in mobydick he piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the generalrage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as ifhis chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon itit is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise atthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at themonster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionatecorporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him heprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing moreyet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for longmonths of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched together inone hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagoniancape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into oneanother and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then onthe homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomaniaseized him seems all but certain from the fact that at intervalsduring the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of aleg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and wasmoreover intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced tolace him fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock in astraitjacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales and whenrunning into more sufferable latitudes the ship with mild stunsailsspread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearancesthe old mans delirium seemed left behind him with the cape hornswells and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light andair even then when he bore that firm collected front however paleand issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god thedireful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden selfraved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thingwhen you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into somestill subtler form ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeninglycontracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flowsnarrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but as in hisnarrowflowing monomania not one jot of ahabs broad madness had beenleft behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great naturalintellect had perished that before living agent now became the livinginstrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacystormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all itsconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having losthis

dissembling that whenwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought himotherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with theterrible casualty which had overtaken himthe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularlyascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness whichalways afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on thepresent voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikelythat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage onaccount of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudentisle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasonshe was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so fullof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within andscorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurableidea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to darthis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutesor if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for thatyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl onhis underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it isthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed inhim ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the oneonly and allengrossing object of hunting the white whale had any oneof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurkingin him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls havewrenched the ship from such a fiendish man

of the time and theplace but while yet all arush to encounter the whale could seenaught in that brute but the deadliest illchapter 42 the whiteness of the whalewhat the white whale was to ahab has been hinted what at times hewas to me as yet remains unsaidaside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick whichcould not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarm therewas another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning himwhich at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the restand yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almostdespair of putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness ofthe whale that above all things appalled me but how can i hope toexplain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself imust else all these chapters might be naughtthough in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beautyas if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marblesjaponicas and pearls and though various nations have in some wayrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaricgrand old kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephantsabove all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and themodern kings of siam unfurling the same snowwhite quadruped in theroyal standard and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of asnowwhite charger and

sympathies and symbolizings this same hue ismade the emblem of many touching noble thingsthe innocence of bridesthe benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving ofthe white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor though inmany climes whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine ofthe judge and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawnby milkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the mostaugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessnessand power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flamebeing held

whitebefore the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth therewhite like wool yet for all these accumulated associations withwhatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks anelusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes moreof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in bloodthis elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness whendivorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any objectterrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest boundswitness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of thetropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them thetranscendent horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is whichimparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrificto the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fiercefangedtiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteshroudedbear or sharkwith reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him whowould fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not thewhiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerablehideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousnessit might be said only rises from the circumstance that theirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in thefleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing togethertwo such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens uswith so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be trueyet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensifiedterroras for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in thatcreature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with thesame quality in the polar quadruped this

those clouds of spiritualwonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in allimaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but gods greatunflattering laureate naturei remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during a prolongedgale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watchbelow i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon themain hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness andwith a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth itsvast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrousflutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it utteredcries as some kings ghost in supernatural distress through itsinexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which tookhold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the whitething was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiledwaters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and oftowns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can onlyhint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke andturning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goneynever had heard that name before is it conceivable that this gloriousthing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after ilearned that goney was some seamans name for albatross so that by nopossibility could coleridges wild rhyme have had aught to do withthose mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird uponour deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird tobe an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish alittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poeti assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the birdchiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced inthis that by a solecism of terms there are birds called greyalbatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with suchemotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowlbut how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i willtell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the seaat last the captain made a postman of it tying a

rocky mountains and the alleghanies attheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star whichevery evening leads on the hosts of light the flashing cascade of hismane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings moreresplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnished him amost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen westernworld which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived theglories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a godbluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amidhis aides and marshals

questioned from what stands on legendary record of thisnoble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which soclothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in itwhich though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certainnameless terrorbut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all thataccessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed

its snowy aspect thegauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the whitesquall nor in some historic instances has the art of human maliceomitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect ofthat passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of theirfaction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in themarketplacenor in some things does the common hereditary experience of allmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue itcannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect ofthe dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingeringthere as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge ofconsternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here andfrom that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of theshroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we failto throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising ina milkwhite fogyea while these terrors seize us let us add thateven the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides onhis pallid horsetherefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or graciousthing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundestidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soulbut though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man toaccount for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then bythe citation of some of those instances wherein this thing ofwhitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great part strippedof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearfulbut nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery howevermodifiedcan we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct usto the hidden cause we seeklet us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtletyand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls andthough doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions aboutto be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps wereentirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be ableto recall them nowwhy to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but looselyacquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the baremention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long drearyspeechless processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hoodedwith newfallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant ofthe middle american states why does the passing mention of a whitefriar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soulor what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors andkings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white towerof london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of anuntravelled american than those other storied structures itsneighborsthe byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimertowers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiarmoods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the baremention of that name while the thought of virginias blue ridge isfull of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of alllatitudes and longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such aspectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us withmortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the wavesfollowed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose awholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why inreading the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale manof the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glidesthrough the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible thanall the whooping imps of the blocksburgnor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltopplingearthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor thetearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her

cardsitis not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangestsaddest city thou canst see for lima has taken the white veil andthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarrothis whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerfulgreenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigidpallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortionsi know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whitenessis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror ofobjects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is thereaught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mindalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially whenexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness oruniversality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps berespectively elucidated by the following examplesfirst the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands ifby night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feelsjust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but underprecisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock toview his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessas iffrom encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimminground him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shroudedphantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost invain the lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helmthey both go down he never rests till blue water is under him againyet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so muchthe fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideouswhiteness that so stirred mesecond to the native indian of peru the continual sight of thesnowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in themere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vastaltitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be tolose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with thebackwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference views anunbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twigto break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholdingthe scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernaltrick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he

at once the mostmeaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of thechristians deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agentin things the most appalling to mankindis it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voidsand immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with thethought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milkyway or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour asthe visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of allcolours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blanknessfull of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless allcolourof atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theoryof the natural philosophers that all other earthly huesevery

you would have seen him go to a locker in thetransom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish seacharts spread them before him on his screweddown table then seatinghimself before it you would have seen him intently study the variouslines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steadypencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank atintervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him whereinwere set down the seasons and places in which on various formervoyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seenwhile thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over hishead continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for everthrew shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow tillit almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines andcourses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracinglines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his foreheadbut it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of hiscabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they werebrought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced andothers were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans beforehim ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view tothe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soulnow to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathansit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitarycreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seemto ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and therebycalculating the driftings of the sperm whales food and also callingto mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particularlatitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching tocertainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or thatground in search of his preyso assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of thesperm whales resorting to given waters that many hunters believethat could he be closely observed and studied throughout the worldwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefullycollated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found tocorrespond in invariability to those of the herringshoals or theflights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to constructelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale  since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by  an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national  observatory washington april 16th 1851 by that circular it  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and  portions of it are presented in the circular this chart divides the  ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of  longitude perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve  columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each of which  districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have  been spent in each month in every district and the two others to  show the number of days in which whales sperm or right have been  seenbesides when making a passage from one feedingground to another thesperm whales guided by some infallible instinctsay rather secretintelligence from the deitymostly swim in veins as they are calledcontinuing their way along a given oceanline with such undeviatingexactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with onetithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases thedirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyors paralleland though the line of advance be strictly confined to its ownunavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at thesetimes he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in widthmore or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract butnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whaleships mastheads whencircumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that atparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path migratingwhales may with great confidence be looked forand hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separatefeedinggrounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossingthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by hisart so place and time himself on his way as even then not to bewholly without prospect of a meetingthere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle hisdelirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the realityperhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasonsfor particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that theherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this yearsay will turn out to be identically the same with those that werefound there the preceding season though there are peculiar andunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true ingeneral the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to thesolitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so thatthough moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on whatis called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay onthe japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod tovisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season shewould infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feedinggrounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemedonly his casual stoppingplaces and oceaninns so to speak not hisplaces of prolonged abode and where ahabs chances of accomplishinghis object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made towhatever wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere aparticular set time or place were attained when all possibilitieswould become probabilities and as ahab fondly thought everypossibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time andplace were conjoined in the one technical phrasetheseasonontheline for there and then for several consecutive yearsmoby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters forawhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predictedinterval in any one sign of the zodiac there it was too that most ofthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there thewaves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spotwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to hisvengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloiteringvigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfalteringhunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the onecrowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to thosehopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize hisunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening questnow the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of theseasonontheline no possible endeavor then could enable hercommander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn andthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorialpacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the nextensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequods sailing hadperhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this verycomplexion of things because an interval of three hundred andsixtyfive days and nights was before him an interval which insteadof impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous huntif by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remotefrom his periodical feedinggrounds should turn up his wrinkled browoff the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in anyother waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampasnorwesters harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoonmight blow moby dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of thepequods circumnavigating wakebut granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems itnot but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean onesolitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable ofindividual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded muftiin the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiarsnowwhite brow of moby dick and his snowwhite hump could not but beunmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter tohimself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight hewould throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escapehis broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheeps earand here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till aweariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open airof the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god whattrances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with oneunachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakeswith his own bloody nails in his palmsoften when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vividdreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts throughthe day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled themround and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbingof his lifespot became insufferable anguish and when as wassometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being upfrom its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forkedflames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leapdown among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wildcry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab wouldburst from his state room as though escaping from a bed that was onfire yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptomsof some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but theplainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab thescheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahabthat had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him toburst from it in horror again the latter was the eternal livingprinciple or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociatedfrom the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for itsouter vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from thescorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time itwas no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unlessleagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahabscase yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supremepurpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forceditself against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independentbeing of its own nay could grimly live and burn while the commonvitality to which it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from theunbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit thatglared out of bodily eyes when what seemed ahab rushed from his roomwas for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic beinga ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour andtherefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thoughtshave created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thusmakes him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever thatvulture the very creature he createschapter 45 the affidavitso far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeedas indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curiousparticulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter inits earlier part is as important a one as will be found in thisvolume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further andmore familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understoodand moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance ofthe entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verityof the main points of this affairi care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall becontent to produce the desired impression by separate citations ofitems practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and fromthese citations i take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturallyfollow of itselffirst i have personally known three instances where a whale afterreceiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after aninterval in one instance of three years has been again struck by thesame hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the sameprivate cypher have been taken from the body in the instance wherethree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and ithink it may have been something more than that the man who dartedthem happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage toafrica went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated farinto the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two yearsoften endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas withall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart ofunknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have beenon its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globebrushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purposethis man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished theother i say i myself have known three instances similar to thisthat is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the secondattack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in themafterwards taken from the dead fish in the threeyear instance it sofell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and thelast time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under thewhales eye which i had observed there three years previous i saythree years but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are threeinstances then which i personally know the truth of but i have heardof many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter thereis no good ground to impeachsecondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorantthe world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorablehistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been atdistant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale becamethus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodilypeculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiarin that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to hispeculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarlyvaluable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiencesof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness aboutsuch a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that mostfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching theirtarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the seawithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like somepoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man theymake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if theypursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thumpfor their presumptionbut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individualcelebritynay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was hefamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after deathbut he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctionsof a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or cæsar was it notso o timor tom

thenarragansett woods captain butler of old had it in his mind to capturethat notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of theindian king philipi do not know where i can find a better place than just here to makemention of one or two other things which to me seem important as inprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of thewhole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe forthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires fullas much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of some ofthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without somehints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of thefishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or stillworse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegoryfirst though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the generalperils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vividconception of those perils and the frequency with which they recurone reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disastersand deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record athome however transient and immediately forgotten that record do yousuppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught bythe whaleline off the coast of new guinea is being carried down tothe bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose thatthat poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you willread tomorrow at your breakfast no because the mails are veryirregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear whatmight be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet itell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacificamong many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of whichhad had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three thathad each lost a boats crew for gods sake be economical with yourlamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop ofmans blood was spilled for itsecondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whaleis an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found thatwhen narrating to them some specific example of this twofoldenormousness they have significantly complimented me upon myfacetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea ofbeing facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plagues ofegyptbut fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upontestimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the spermwhale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciouslymalicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroyand sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has done itfirst in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucketwas cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered herboats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several ofthe whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escapingfrom the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon theship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in thatin less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not asurviving plank of her has been seen since after the severestexposure part of the crew reached the land in their boats beingreturned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacificin command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again uponunknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterlylost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it sinceat this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seenowen chace who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedyi have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with hisson and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophethe following are extracts from chaces narrative every fact seemedto warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance whichdirected his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship ata short interval between them both of which according to theirdirection were calculated to do us the most injury by being madeahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for theshock to effect which the exact manœuvres which he made werenecessary his aspect was most horrible and such as indicatedresentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had justbefore entered and in which we had struck three of his companions asif fired with revenge for their sufferings again at all events thewhole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyesand producing at the time impressions in my mind of decidedcalculating mischief on the part of the whale many of whichimpressions i cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that i amcorrect in my opinionhere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during ablack night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching anyhospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing thefears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed uponhidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearfulcontemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought thedismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whalewholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearancein another placep 45he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attackof the animalsecondly the ship union also of nantucket was in the year 1807totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authenticparticulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounterthough from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casualallusions to itthirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j thencommanding an american sloopofwar of the first class happened to bedining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship inthe harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whalesthe commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strengthascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorilydenied for example that any whale could so smite his stoutsloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful verygood but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore setsail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped onthe way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few momentsconfidential business with him that business consisted in fetching thecommodores craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he madestraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am notsuperstitious but i consider the commodores interview with that whaleas providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by asimilar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsensei will now refer you to langsdorffs voyages for a little circumstancein point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff youmust know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusensternsfamous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present centurycaptain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapterby the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next daywe were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather wasvery clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged tokeep on our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it wasnot till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang upan uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the shipitself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceivedby any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in fullsail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent itsstriking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent dangeras this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship threefeet at least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fellaltogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deckconcluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we sawthe monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captaindwolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not thevessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that veryhappily it had escaped entirely uninjurednow the captain dwolf here alluded to as commanding the ship inquestion is a new englander who after a long life of unusualadventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village ofdorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephew of his ihave particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorffhe substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a largeone a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by myuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from homein that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so fulltoo of honest wondersthe voyage of lionel wafer one of ancientdampiers old chumsi found a little matter set down so like that justquoted from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for acorroborative example if such be neededlionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls themodern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about fouroclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fiftyleagues from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock whichput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell wherethey were or what to think but every one began to prepare for deathand indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it forgranted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement wasa little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground     the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in theircarriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammockscaptain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of hiscabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake andseems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a greatearthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischiefalong the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in thedarkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after allcaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneathi might proceed with several more examples one way or another known tome of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in morethan one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailingboats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and longwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english shippusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength letme say that there have been examples where the lines attached to arunning sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship andsecured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as ahorse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that ifthe sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then actsnot so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs ofdestruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquentindication of his character that upon being attacked he willfrequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion forseveral consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one moreand a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant oneby which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellousevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day butthat these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the agesso that for the millionth time we say amen with solomonverily there isnothing new under the sunin the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrateof constantinople in the days when justinian was emperor andbelisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his owntimes a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities hehas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggeratinghistorian except in some one or two particulars not at all affectingthe matter presently to be mentionednow in this history of his procopius mentions that during the termof his prefecture at constantinople a great seamonster was capturedin the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyedvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fiftyyears a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily begainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise speciesthis seamonster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships aswell as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am stronglyinclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a longtime i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in themediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i amcertain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in thepresent constitution of things a place for his habitual gregariousresort but further investigations have recently proved to me that inmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of thesperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that onthe barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found theskeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passesthrough the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same routepass out of the mediterranean into the propontisin the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiarsubstance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whalebut i have every reason to believe that the food of the spermwhalesquid or cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea becauselarge creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have beenfound at its surface if then you properly put these statementstogether and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive thataccording to all human reasoning procopiuss seamonster that forhalf a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in allprobability have been a sperm whalechapter 46 surmisesthough consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all histhoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of mobydick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to thatone passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature andlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans ways altogetherto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least ifthis were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much moreinfluential with him it would be refining too much perhaps evenconsidering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards thewhite whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to allsperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more hemultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale wouldprove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis beindeed exceptionable there were still additional considerations whichthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his rulingpassion yet were by no means incapable of swaying himto accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used inthe shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knewfor example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects wasover starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritualman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectualmastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand ina sort of corporeal relation starbucks body and starbucks coercedwill were ahabs so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbucks brainstill he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorredhis captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himselffrom it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval wouldelapse ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuckwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against hiscaptains leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantialinfluences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtleinsanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantlymanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeingthat for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of thatstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that thefull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscurebackground for few mens courage is proof against protractedmeditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long nightwatches his officers and men must have some nearer things to think ofthan moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew hadhailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts aremore or less capricious and unreliablethey live in the varying outerweather and they inhale its ficklenessand when retained for anyobject remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life andpassion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporaryinterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthilysuspended for the final dashnor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotionmankind disdain all base considerations but such times

their savageness evenbreeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while forthe love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have foodfor their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted andchivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse twothousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre withoutcommitting burglaries picking pockets and gaining other piousperquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one finaland romantic objectthat final and romantic object too many would haveturned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab ofall hopes of cashaye cash they may scorn cash now but let somemonths go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then thissame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash wouldsoon cashier ahabnor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more relatedto ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhapssomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of thepequods voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing hehad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge ofusurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crewif so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all furtherobedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command fromeven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possibleconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab mustof course have been most anxious to protect himself that protectioncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and handbacked by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minuteatmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to besubjected tofor all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to beverbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a gooddegree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequodsvoyage observe all customary usages and not only that but forcehimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the generalpursuit of his professionbe all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the threemastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout and not omitreporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without rewardchapter 47 the matmakerit was a cloudy sultry afternoon

from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who wassurrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of airchapter 48 the first loweringthe phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other sideof the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose thetackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had alwaysbeen deemed one of the spare boats though technically called thecaptains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter thefigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one whitetooth evilly protruding from its steellike lips a rumpled chinesejacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide blacktrowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonnesswas a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided andcoiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect thecompanions of this figure were of that vivid tigeryellow complexionpeculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillasa racenotorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest whitemariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agentson the water of the devil their lord whose

the most terrific things to his crew in atone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed socalculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hearsuch queer invocations

instantas the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonablyawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the shipscompany but archys fancied discovery having some time previous gotabroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in somesmall measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edgeof their wonder and so what with all this and stubbs confident way ofaccounting for their appearance they were for the time freed fromsuperstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant roomfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahabs precise agency inthe matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled themysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during thedim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of theunaccountable elijahmeantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided thefurthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats acircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was

water like a horizontal burstboiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seenpulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket anddisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above thegunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the wateryhorizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like afencers thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalanceany tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oaras in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him allat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remainedfixed while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boatand crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats inthe rear paused on their way

heated plates of iron beneath thisatmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer ofwater also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the otherindications the puffs of vapor

sharp fixed glancefrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as twovisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say muchto his crew though nor did his crew say

hedeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with itstailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike thatthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful

hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseenand unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i amspeaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulationit comes in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just beforemight have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a partof the general joke there is nothing like the perils of whaling tobreed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and withit i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great whitewhale its objectqueequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to thedeck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off thewater queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing oftenhappen without much emotion though soaked through just like me hegave me to understand that such things did often happenmr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in hisoiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb ithink i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chiefmate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i supposethen that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggysquall is the height of a whalemans discretioncertain ive lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale offcape hornmr flask said i turning to little kingpost who was standingclose by you are experienced in these things and i am not will youtell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flaskfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself backforemost intodeaths jawscant you twist that smaller said flask yes thats the law ishould like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale faceforemost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mindthathere then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statementof the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizingsin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters ofcommon occurrence in this kind of life considering that at thesuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resignmy life into the hands of him who steered the boatoftentimes a fellowwho at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point ofscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering thatthe particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to beimputed to starbucks driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of asquall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous forhis great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged tothis uncommonly prudent starbucks boat and finally considering inwhat a devils chase i was implicated touching the white whale takingall things together i say i thought i might as well go below and makea rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall bemy lawyer executor and legateeit may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering attheir last wills and testaments but there are no people in the worldmore fond of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nauticallife that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concludedupon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolledaway from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be asgood as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection asupplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case mightbe i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chesti looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with aclean conscience sitting inside the bars

boat and crew fedallahwho would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one legyou would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plugholewith my timber toe oh hes a wonderful old mani dont think it so strange after all on that account said flaskif his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thingthat would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the otherleft you knowi dont know that my little man i never yet saw him kneelamong whalewise people it has often been argued whether consideringthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage itis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the activeperils of the chase so tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tears intheir eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carriedinto the thickest of the fightbut with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering thatwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of dangerconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great andextraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed thencomprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimedman to enter a whaleboat in the hunt as a general thing thejointowners of the pequod must have plainly thought notahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little ofhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes ofthe chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and givinghis orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actuallyapportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntabove all forcaptain ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boatscrew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the headsof the owners of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boatscrew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that headnevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all thatmatter until cabacos published discovery the sailors had littleforeseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out ofport all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting thewhaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and thenfound bestirring himself in the matter of making tholepins with hisown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and evensolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line isrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this wasobserved in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extracoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it betterwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxietyhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as itis sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracingthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it wasobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary kneefixed in the semicircular depression in the cleat and with thecarpenters chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it alittle there all these things i say had awakened much interest andcuriosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that thisparticular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view tothe ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed hisintention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a suppositiondid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boats crewbeing assigned to that boatnow with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon wanedaway for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then suchunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknownnooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws ofwhalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castawaycreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreckoars whaleboats canoes blownoff japanese junks and what not thatbeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabinto chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduableexcitement in the forecastlebut be all this as it may certain it is that

pequod had slowlyswept across four several cruisinggrounds that off the azores offthe cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth ofthe rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked waterylocality southerly from st helenait was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene andmoonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silverand by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silverysilence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seenfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon itlooked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising fromthe sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlightnights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand alookout there with the same precision as if it had been day and yetthough herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in ahundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with whatemotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft atsuch unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky butwhen after spending his uniform interval there for several successivenights without uttering a single sound when after all this silencehis unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jetevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirithad lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there sheblows had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quiveredmore yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it wasa most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriouslyexciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired aloweringwalking the deck with quick sidelunging strides ahab commanded thetgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread thebest man in the ship must take the helm then with every mastheadmanned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind the strangeupheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollowsof so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like airbeneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonisticinfluences were struggling in herone to mount direct to heaven theother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watchedahabs face that night you would have thought that in him also twodifferent things were warring while his one live leg made livelyechoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like acoffintap on life and death this old man walked but though the shipso swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eagerglances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night everysailor swore he saw it once but not a second timethis midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some daysafter lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again itwas descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more itdisappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night afternight till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jettedinto the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might bedisappearing again for one whole day or two days or three andsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing stillfurther and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for everalluring us onnor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordancewith the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things investedthe pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore thatwhenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in howeverfar apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast byone selfsame whale and that whale moby dick for a time therereigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition asif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that themonster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotestand most savage seasthese temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived awondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather inwhich beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked adevilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas sowearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengefulerrand seemed vacating itself of life before our urnlike prowbut at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds beganhowling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seasthat are there when the ivorytusked pequod sharply bowed to theblast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers ofsilver chips the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all thisdesolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights moredismal than beforeclose to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thitherbefore us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable searavens andevery morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen andspite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hempas though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft athing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roostingplace fortheir homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heavedthe black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the greatmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and sufferingit had bredcape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoso as calledof yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before hadattended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea whereguilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemedcondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beatthat black air without any horizon but calm snowwhite andunvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky stillbeckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times bedescriedduring all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming forthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerousdeck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than everaddressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everythingabove and aloft has been secured nothing more can be done butpassively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew becomepractical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into itsaccustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab forhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while anoccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his veryeyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward part ofthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bowsstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better toguard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into asort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosenedbelt few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned bypainted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swiftmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves by night the same mutenessof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silencethe men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to theblast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would notseek that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the oldmans aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how thebarometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in hisfloorscrewed chair the rain and halfmelted sleet of the storm fromwhich he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from theunremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one ofthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spokenof his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the bodywas erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes werepointed towards the needle of the telltale that swung from a beam inthe ceilingthe cabincompass is called the telltale because without going tothe compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himselfof the course of the shipterrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in thisgale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purposechapter 52 the albatrosssoutheastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruisingground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatrossby name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at theforemasthead i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyroin the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from homeas if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like theskeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectralappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while allher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furredover with hoarfrost only her lower sails were set a wild sight itwas to see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads theyseemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raimentthat had survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoopsnailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea andthough when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six menin the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leapedfrom the mastheads of one ship to those of the other yet thoseforlornlooking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said notone word to our own lookouts while the quarterdeck hail was beingheard from belowship ahoy have ye seen the white whalebut as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was inthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from hishand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove tomake himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasingthe distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of thepequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at thefirst mere mention of the white whales name to another ship ahab fora moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered aboat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade buttaking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpetand knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketerand shortly bound home he loudly hailedahoy there this is thepequod bound round the world tell them to address all future lettersto the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at hometell them to address them to at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly thenin accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fishthat for some days before had been placidly swimming by our sidedarted away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselvesfore and aft with the strangers flanks though in the course of hiscontinual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similarsight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciouslycarry meaningsswim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the waterthere seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more ofdeep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evincedbut turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship inthe wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lionvoiceup helm keep her off round the worldround the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelingsbut whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only throughnumberless perils to the very point whence we started where those thatwe left behind secure were all the time before uswere this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could forever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strangethan any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promisein the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or intormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swimsbefore all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe theyeither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmedchapter 53 the gamthe ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we hadspoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had thisnot been the case he would not after all perhaps have boardedherjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it hadbeen that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answerto the question he put for as it eventually turned out he cared notto consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain except hecould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought butall this might remain inadequately estimated were not something saidhere of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when meeting each otherin foreign seas and especially on a common cruisinggroundif two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or theequally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encounteringeach other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life ofthem cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a momentto interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while andresting in concert then how much more natural that upon theillimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whalingvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthoff lonefannings island or the far away kings mills how much more naturali say that under such circumstances these ships should not onlyinterchange hails but come into still closer more friendly andsociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter ofcourse in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whosecaptains officers and not a few of the men are personally known toeach other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things totalk aboutfor the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letters onboard at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of adate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred andthumbworn files and in return for that courtesy the outwardboundship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from thecruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmostimportance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerningwhaling vessels crossing each others track on the cruisinggrounditself even though they are equally long absent from home for one ofthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third and nowfar remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people ofthe ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling newsand have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all thesympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiarcongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually sharedprivations and perilsnor would difference of country make any very essential differencethat is so long as both parties speak one language as is the casewith americans and english though to be sure from the small numberof english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and whenthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between themfor your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does notfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the englishwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over theamerican whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with hisnondescript provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant but where thissuperiority in the english whalemen does really consist it would behard to say seeing that the yankees in one day collectively killmore whales than all the english collectively in ten years but thisis a harmless little foible in the english whalehunters which thenantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knowsthat he has a few foibles himselfso then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea thewhalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so whereas somemerchant ships crossing each others wake in the midatlantic willoftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognitionmutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandiesin broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticismupon each others rig as for menofwar when they chance to meet atsea they first go through such a string of silly bowings andscrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to bemuch rightdown hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all astouching slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurrythey run away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirateswhen they chance to cross each others crossbones the first hailishow many skullsthe same way that whalers hailhow manybarrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steerapart for they are infernal villains on both sides and dont like tosee overmuch of each others villanous likenessesbut look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociablefreeandeasy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets anotherwhaler in any sort of decent weather she has a gam a thing soutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the nameeven and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at itand repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers andsuch like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchantseamen andalso all pirates and manofwars men and slaveship sailors cherishsuch a scornful feeling towards whaleships this is a question itwould be hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i shouldlike to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar gloryabout it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only atthe gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashionhe has no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence iconclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whalemanin that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand onbut what is a gam you might wear out your indexfinger running upand down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word drjohnson never attained to that erudition noah websters ark does nothold it nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many yearsbeen in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankeescertainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into thelexicon with that view let me learnedly define itgam nouna social meeting of two or more whaleships generallyon a cruisingground when after exchanging hails they exchangevisits by boats crews the two captains remaining for the time onboard of one ship and the two chief mates on the otherthere is another little item about gamming which must not be forgottenhere all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail sohas the whale fishery in a pirate manofwar or slave ship when thecaptain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the sternsheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and oftensteers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated withgay cords and ribbons but the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofaof that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed ifwhaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty oldaldermen in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whaleboat neveradmits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a completeboats crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer orharpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon theoccasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off tohis visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice thatbeing conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on himfrom the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive tothe importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs noris this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projectingsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back theafteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thuscompletely wedged before and behind and can only expand himselfsideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violentpitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length offoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make aspread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then againit would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes it wouldnever do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadyinghimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with hishands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommand hegenerally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps beinggenerally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballastnevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated onestoo where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical momentor two in a sudden squall

was encountered she was mannedalmost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave usstrong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the whitewhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the townhosstory which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certainwondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments ofgod which at times are said to overtake some men this lattercircumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what maybe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated neverreached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part ofthe story was unknown to the captain of the townho himself it was theprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one ofwhom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions ofsecrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep andrevealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he couldnot well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence didthis thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the fullknowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so werethey governed in this matter that they kept the secret amongthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequods mainmastinterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story aspublicly narrated on the ship the

fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian wereon the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions theyoccasionally put and which are duly answered at the timesome two years prior to my first learning the events which i am aboutrehearsing to you gentlemen the townho sperm whaler of nantucketwas cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastwardfrom the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to thenorthward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps accordingto daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her holdthan common they supposed a swordfish had stabbed her gentlemen butthe captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare goodluck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse toquit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerousthough indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as lowdown as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continuedher cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easyintervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only wasthe leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so thatnow taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for thenearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out andrepairedthough no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chancefavoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by theway because his pumps were of the best and being periodicallyrelieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep theship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth wellnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperousbreezes the townho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety ather port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not beenfor the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and thebitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado

him down on the lone nantucketbeach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had longfollowed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet washe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoodsseaman fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives yetwas this nantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and thislakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet byinflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of humanrecognition which is the meanest slaves right thus treated thissteelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events hehad proved so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad andsteelkiltbut gentlemen you shall hearit was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing herprow for her island haven that the townhos leak seemed againincreasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumpsevery day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like ouratlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping theirwhole way across it though of a still sleepy night should theofficer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect theprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never againremember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottomnor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westwardgentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at theirpumphandles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable lengththat is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any otherreasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel isin some very out of the way part of those waters some really landlesslatitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxiousmuch this way had it been with the townho so when her leak was foundgaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested byseveral of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded theupper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every wayexpanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of acoward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensivenesstouching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land oron sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when hebetrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of theseamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part ownerin her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there wason this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as theystood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clearwater clear as any mountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from thepumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts atthe lee scupperholesnow as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventionalworld of ourswatery or otherwise that when a person placed in commandover his fellowmen finds one of them to be very significantly hissuperior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man heconceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have achance he will pull down and pulverize that subalterns tower and makea little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it maygentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with ahead like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseledhousings of your last viceroys snorting charger and a brain and aheart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkiltcharlemagne had he been born son to charlemagnes father but radneythe mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicioushe did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew itespying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with therest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on withhis gay banteringsaye aye my merry lads its a lively leak this hold a cannikinone of ye and lets have a taste by the lord its worth bottling itell ye what men old rads investment must go for it he had best cutaway his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys thatswordfish only began the job hes come back again with a gang ofshipcarpenters sawfish and filefish and what not and the wholeposse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottommaking improvements i suppose if old rad were here now id tell himto jump overboard and scatter em theyre playing the devil with hisestate i can tell him but hes a simple old soulrad and a beautytoo boys they say the rest of his property is invested inlookingglasses i wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the modelof his nosedamn your eyes whats that pump stopping for roared radneypretending not to have heard the sailors talk thunder away at itaye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boyslively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fireenginesthe men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gaspingof the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of lifesutmost energiesquitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman wentforward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his facefiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from hisbrow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radneyto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i knownot but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the matecommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also ashovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing apig to run at largenow gentlemen sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece of householdwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to everyevening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actuallyfoundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility ofseausages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whomwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in allvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boysif boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in thetownho that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumpsand being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had beenregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he shouldhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with trulynautical duties such being the case with his comrades i mention allthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affairstood between the two menbut there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost asplainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spatin his face any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship willunderstand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakemanfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he satstill for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the matesmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up in himand the slowmatch silently burning along towards them as heinstinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingnessto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful beingarepugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even whenaggrievedthis nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole oversteelkilttherefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodilyexhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweepingthe deck was not his business and he would not do it and thenwithout at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as thecustomary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had donelittle or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in amost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating hiscommand meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with anuplifted coopers club hammer which he had snatched from a cask nearbyheated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps forall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkiltcould but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow stillsmothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remaineddoggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook thehammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to dohis biddingsteelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadilyfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeatedhis intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance hadnot the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation withhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but itwas to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round thewindlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking himthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor thelakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officermr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look toyourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him wherethe lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch ofhis

hisright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told hispersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt wouldmurder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughterby the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instantthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatchspouting blood like a whaleere the cry could go aft

shadow and the snug patronising lee of churchesfor by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitanfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice sosinners gentlemen

often one of the prime redeemingqualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an armto back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one insum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is isemphatically evinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains somany of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race ofmankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whalingcaptains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matterthat to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along itsline the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the soletransition between quietly reaping in a christian cornfield andrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seasi see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chichaupon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the worlds one lima ihad thought now that at your temperate north the generations werecold and holy as the hillsbut the storyi left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardlyhad he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates andthe four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding downthe ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into theuproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastleothers of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twistedturmoil ensued while standing out of harms way the valiant captaindanced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his officers tomanhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to thequarterdeck at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border ofthe confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought toprick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and hisdesperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining theforecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casksin a line with the windlass these seaparisians entrenched themselvesbehind the barricadecome out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing themwith a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward comeout of that ye cutthroatssteelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down theredefied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain tounderstand distinctly that his steelkilts death would be the signalfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heartlest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted butstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their dutywill you promise not to touch us if we do demanded theirringleaderturn to turn toi make no promiseto your duty do you want tosink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and heonce more raised a pistolsink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of usturns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against us whatsay ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was theirresponsethe lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eyeon the captain and jerking out such sentences as theseits not ourfault we didnt want it i told him to take his hammer away it wasboys business he might have known me before this i told him not toprick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against hiscursed jaw aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle theremen look to those handspikes my hearties

now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards himthere are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped forthe cruise dye see now as you well know sir we can claim ourdischarge as soon as the anchor is down so we dont want a row itsnot our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but wewont be floggedturn to roared the captainsteelkilt glanced round him a moment and then saidi tell you whatit is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabbyrascal we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but tillyou say the word about not flogging us we dont do a hands turndown into the forecastle then down with ye ill keep ye there tillyere sick of it down ye goshall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were againstit but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him downinto their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a caveas the lakemans bare head was just level with the planks the captainand his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slideof the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly calledfor the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to thecompanionway then opening the slide a little the captain whisperedsomething down the crack closed it and turned the key upon themtenin numberleaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far hadremained neutralall night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forward andaft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway atwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge afterbreaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passedin peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at thepumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the drearynight dismally resounded through the shipat sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the decksummoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water wasthen lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit weretossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing itthe captain returned to the quarterdeck twice every day for threedays this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wranglingand then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was deliveredand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they wereready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing dietunited perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrainedthem to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captainreiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him aterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where hebelonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted upinto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrainthem only three were leftbetter turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeershut us up again will ye cried steelkiltoh certainly said the captain and the key clickedit was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection ofseven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that hadlast hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place asblack as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed tothe two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burstout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed withtheir keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with ahandle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and ifby any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship forhimself he would do this he said whether they joined him or notthat was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme metwith no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they wereready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but asurrender and what was more they each insisted upon being the firstman on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to thistheir leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himselfparticularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the otherin the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladderwould but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul playof these miscreants must come outupon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his ownseparate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same pieceof treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to bethe first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender andthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct mightmerit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to leadthem to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry ofvillany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when theirleader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other inthree sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him withcords and shrieked out for the captain at midnightthinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood heand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in afew minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the stillstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidiousallies who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had beenfully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged alongthe deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into themizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung tillmorning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before themthe vultures would not touch ye ye villainsat sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who hadrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told theformer that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought upon thewhole he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it but for thepresent considering their timely surrender he would let them go witha reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacularbut as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in theriggingfor you i mean to mince ye up for the trypots and seizinga rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the twotraitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their headssideways as the two crucified thieves are drawnmy wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is stillrope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldnt give up takethat gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himselffor a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of hiscramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in asort of hiss what i say is thisand mind it wellif you flog me imurder yousay ye so then see how ye frighten meand the captain drew off withthe rope to strikebest not hissed the lakemanbut i mustand the rope was once more drawn back for the strokesteelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captainwho to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deckrapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his ropesaid i wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hearbut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a paleman with a bandaged head arrested themradney the chief mate eversince the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing thetumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched thewhole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardlyspeak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to dowhat the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advancedto his pinioned foeyou are a coward hissed the lakemanso i am but take that the mate was in the very act of strikingwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausingno more made good his word spite of steelkilts threat whatever thatmight have been the three men were then cut down all hands wereturned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumpsclanged as beforejust after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamorwas heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running upbesieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crewentreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their owninstance they were put down in the ships run for salvation still nosign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemedthat mainly at steelkilts instigation they had resolved to maintainthe strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when theship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure thespeediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thingnamelynot to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered forspite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the townho stillmaintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lowerfor a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck thecruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change hisberth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death thevital jaw of the whalebut though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort ofpassiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least tillall was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon theman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radneythe chief mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run morethan half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging heinsisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming thehead of his watch at night upon this and one or two othercircumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revengeduring the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on thebulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale ofthe boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ships side inthis attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was aconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down betweenthis was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that hisnext trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in the morningof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at hisleisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefullyin his watches belowwhat are you making there said a shipmatewhat do you think what does it look likelike a lanyard for your bag but its an odd one seems to meyes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arms lengthbefore him but i think it will answer shipmate i havent enoughtwinehave you anybut there was none in the forecastlethen i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aftyou dont mean to go a begging to him said a sailorwhy not do you think he wont do me a turn when its to helphimself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at himquietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was givenhimneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night aniron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of thelakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammockfor a pillow twentyfour hours after his trick at the silenthelmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always readydug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come and in theforeordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark andstretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed inbut gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloodydeed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being theavenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step into take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would havedoneit was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the secondday when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffeman drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out thereshe rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dickmoby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but dowhales have christenings whom call you moby dicka very white and famous and most

chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend looksfaintfill up his empty glassno need gentlemen one moment and i proceednow gentlemen sosuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of theshipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement of themoment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily liftedhis voice for the monster though for some little time past it had beenplainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads all was now a phrensythe white whalethe white whale was the cry from captain mates andharpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious tocapture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyedaskance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky massthat lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like aliving opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatalitypervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped outbefore the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman ofthe mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next himwhile radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in orslacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boatswere lowered the mates got the start and none howled more fiercelywith delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after astiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radneysprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boatand now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whales topmost backnothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blindingfoam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boatstruck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out thestanding mate that instant as he fell on the whales slippery backthe boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney wastossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struckout through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through thatveil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick butthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmerbetween his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong againand went downmeantime at the first tap of the boats bottom the lakeman hadslackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmlylooking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrificdownward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line hecut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick roseagain with some tatters of radneys red woollen shirt caught in theteeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but thewhale eluded them and finally wholly disappearedin good time the townho reached her porta savage solitaryplacewhere no civilized creature resided there headed by thelakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately desertedamong the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large doublewarcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harborthe ships company being reduced to but a handful the captain calledupon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heavingdown the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance overtheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated bothby night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwentthat upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such aweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in soheavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored theship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannonfrom the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning theislanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man withhim and setting the sail of his best whaleboat steered straightbefore the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure areinforcement to his crewon the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried whichseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away fromit but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice ofsteelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water thecaptain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yokedwarcanoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if thepistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles andfoamwhat do you want of me cried the captainwhere are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkiltno liesi am bound to tahiti for more menvery good let me board you a momenti come in peace with that heleaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwalestood face to face with the captaincross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me assoon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonderisland and remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strikemea pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leapinginto the sea he swam back to his comradeswatching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to theroots of the cocoanut trees steelkilt made sail again and in duetime arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luckbefriended him two ships were about to sail for france and wereprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailorheaded they embarked and so for ever got the start of their formercaptain had he been at all minded to work them legal retributionsome ten days after the french ships sailed the whaleboat arrivedand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilizedtahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a smallnative schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding allright there again resumed his cruisingswhere steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island ofnantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses togive up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale thatdestroyed him     are you through said don sebastian quietlyi am donthen i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictionsthis your story is in substance really true it is so passingwonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with meif i seem to pressalso bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in donsebastians suit cried the company with exceeding interestis there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inngentlemennay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by whowill quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advisedthis may grow too seriouswill you be so good as to bring the priest also donthough there are no autodafés in lima now said one of the companyto another i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the

lightand hold the holy book before me that i may touch itso help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told yegentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to betrue it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew ihave seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radneychapter 55 of the monstrous pictures of whalesi shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvassomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to theeye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is mooredalongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon thereit may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curiousimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present dayconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set theworld right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale allwrongit may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions willbe found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures forever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marblepanellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shieldsmedallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales ofchainarmor like saladins and a helmeted head like st georges eversince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed notonly in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientificpresentations of himnow by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purportingto be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda ofelephanta in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endlesssculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuitsevery conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any ofthem actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort ournoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth thehindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the walldepicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedlyknown as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man andhalf whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that smallsection of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of ananaconda than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukesbut go to the old galleries and look now at a great christianpainters portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than theantediluvian hindoo it is guidos picture of perseus rescuingandromeda from the seamonster or whale where did guido get the modelof such a strange creature as that nor does hogarth in painting thesame scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit betterthe huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on thesurface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah onits back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows arerolling might be taken for the traitors gate leading from the thamesby water into the tower then there are the prodromus whales of oldscotch sibbald and jonahs whale as depicted in the prints of oldbibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as forthe bookbinders whale winding like a vinestalk round the stock of adescending anchoras stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages ofmany books both old and newthat is a very picturesque but purelyfabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figures onantique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i neverthelesscall this bookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was sointended when the device was first introduced it was introduced by anold italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during therevival of learning and in those days and even down to acomparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be aspecies of the leviathanin the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books youwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where allmanner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold saratoga andbadenbaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in thetitlepage of the original edition of the advancement of learning youwill find some curious whalesbut quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at thosepictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineationsby those who know in old harriss collection of voyages there are someplates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages ad 1671entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in thewhale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plates thewhales like great rafts of logs are represented lying amongiceisles with white bears running over their living backs in anotherplate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale withperpendicular flukesthen again there is an imposing quarto written by one captaincolnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage roundcape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending thespermaceti whale fisheries in this book is an outline purporting tobe a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale fromone killed on the coast of mexico august 1793 and hoisted on decki doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for thebenefit of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me saythat it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scaleto a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale abowwindow some five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye notgive us jonah looking out of that eyenor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for thebenefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness ofmistake look at that popular work goldsmiths animated nature inthe abridged london edition of 1807 there are plates of an allegedwhale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but thisunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for thenarwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in thisnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine uponany intelligent public of schoolboysthen again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacépède a greatnaturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein areseveral pictures of the different species of the leviathan all theseare not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenlandwhale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a longexperienced man as touching that species declares not to have itscounterpart in naturebut the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business wasreserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famousbaron in 1836 he published a natural history of whales in which hegives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing thatpicture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summaryretreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuviers sperm whale isnot a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit ofa whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived thatpicture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessorin the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions thatis from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with thepencil those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform usas for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over theshops of oildealers what shall be said of them they are generallyrichard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savagebreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full ofmariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and bluepaintbut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so verysurprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings havebeen taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as adrawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly representthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and sparsthough elephants have stood for their fulllengths the livingleviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait theliving whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seenat sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is outof sight like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that elementit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodilyinto the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulationsand not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contourbetween a young sucking whale and a fullgrown platonian leviathanyet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to aships deck such is then the outlandish eellike limbered varyingshape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could notcatchbut it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the strandedwhale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not atall for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathanthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape thoughjeremy benthams skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library ofone of his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burlybrowedutilitarian old gentleman with all jeremys other leading personalcharacteristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from anyleviathans articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says themere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fullyinvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that soroundingly envelopes it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in thehead as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it isalso very curiously displayed in the side fin the bones of whichalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only thethumb this fin has four regular bonefingers the index middle ringand little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshycovering as the human fingers in an artificial covering howeverrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said humorous stubb oneday he can never be truly said to handle us without mittensfor all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needsconclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the worldwhich must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit themark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any veryconsiderable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of findingout precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode inwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is bygoing a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk ofbeing eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me youhad best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching thisleviathanchapter 56 of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the truepictures of whaling scenesin connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am stronglytempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of themwhich are to be found in certain books both ancient and modernespecially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i passthat matter byi know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whalecolnetts hugginss frederick cuviers and beales in the previouschapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to hugginss is farbetter than theirs but by great odds beales is the best allbeales drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure inthe picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his secondchapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though nodoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men isadmirably correct and lifelike in its general effect some of thesperm whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contourbut they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault thoughof the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but theyare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he hasbut one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiencybecause it is by such pictures only when at all well done that youcan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen byhis living huntersbut taken for all in all by far the finest though in some detailsnot the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to beanywhere found are two large french engravings well executed andtaken from paintings by one garnery respectively they representattacks on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noblesperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneaththe boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in theair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow ofthe boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon themonsters spine and standing in that prow for that one singleincomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by theincensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as iffrom a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good andtrue the halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the woodenpoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of theswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressionsof affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearingdown upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomicaldetails of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me icould not draw so good a onein the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongsidethe barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls hisblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from thepatagonian cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot sothat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think theremust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls arepecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies andmaccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilentback and all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushing throughthe deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake andcausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nighthe paddlewheels of an ocean steamer thus the foreground is allraging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is theglassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of thepowerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conqueredfortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepoleinserted into his spoutholewho garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it hewas either practically conversant with his subject or elsemarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are thelads for painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europeand where will you find such a gallery of living and breathingcommotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where thebeholder fights his way pellmell through the consecutive greatbattles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northernlights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like acharge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in thatgallery are these sea battlepieces of garnerythe natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness ofthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravingsthey have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of englandsexperience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of theamericans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the onlyfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of thewhale hunt for the most part the english and american whaledraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanicaloutline of things

addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are two otherfrench engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himselfh durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our

attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishlyswam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of thatwondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner

of newfoundland do because of therebeing shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkablemeadowlike appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continuallyfloating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chasedbut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which atall reminded one of mowers seen from the mastheads especially whenthey paused and were stationary for

lives in a dog or a horseindeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of thedeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for thoughsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land areof their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of thething this may very well be yet coming to specialties where forexample does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers tothe sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in anygeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to himbut though to landsmen in general

back to the vesselthe rest as silently followingwhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connectedwith the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of itbeing so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it withportentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of themdeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very fewof them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true natureand form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the spermwhale his only food for though other species of whales find their foodabove water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding thespermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below thesurface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of whatprecisely that food consists at times when closely pursued he willdisgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid someof them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length theyfancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clingsby them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike otherspecies is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear itthere seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishoppontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner inwhich the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking withsome other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond butmuch abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk heassigns itby some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysteriouscreature here spoken of it is included among the class ofcuttlefish to which indeed in certain external respects it wouldseem to belong but only as the anak of the tribechapter 60 the linewith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well asfor the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presentedi have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whalelinethe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightlyvapored with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinaryropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliableto the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself more convenient tothe sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinaryquantity too much stiffen the whaleline for the close coiling to whichit must be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar ingeneral by no means adds to the ropes durability or strength howevermuch it may give it compactness and glossof late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almostentirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though notso durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic andi will add since there is an æsthetics in all things is much morehandsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky darkfellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a goldenhaired circassianto beholdthe whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness at firstsight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experimentits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred andtwenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equalto three tons in length the common sperm whaleline measuressomething over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it isspirally coiled away in the tub not like the wormpipe of a stillthough but so as to form one round cheeseshaped mass of denselybedded sheaves or layers of concentric spiralizations without anyhollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis ofthe cheese as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would inrunning out infallibly take somebodys arm leg or entire body offthe utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub someharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this businesscarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through ablock towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free it from allpossible wrinkles and twistsin the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same linebeing continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage inthis because these twintubs being so small they fit more readily intothe boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tubnearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes arather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinch inthickness for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical ice whichwill bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of aconcentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on theamerican linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with aprodigious great weddingcake to present to the whalesboth ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in aneyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of thetub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everythingthis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts firstin order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from aneighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as tothreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to theharpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mugof ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the firstboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second thisarrangement is indispensable for common safetys sake for were thelower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were thewhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smokingminute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomedboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity ofthe sea and in that case no towncrier would ever find her againbefore lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line istaken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there isagain carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswiseupon the loom or handle of every mans oar so that it jogs against hiswrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternatelysit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in theextreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the sizeof a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks ithangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside theboat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called boxline beingcoiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwalestill a little further aft and is then attached to the shortwarptherope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous tothat connexion the shortwarp goes through sundry mystifications tootedious to detailthus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coilstwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all theoarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timideye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliestsnakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortalwoman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricaciesand while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at anyunknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these

being broughtinto actual playthis is a thing which carries more of true terror thanany other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all menlive enveloped in whalelines all are born with

fishery a mop was used to dash therunning line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin orbailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the mostconvenientfrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper partof the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring youwould have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the water theother the airas the boat churned on through both opposing elements atonce a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddyin her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of alittle finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodicgunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and mainclinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tallform of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in orderto bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacificsseemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whalesomewhat slackened his flighthaul inhaul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing roundtowards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him whileyet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubbfirmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dartinto the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternatelysterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and thenranging up for another flingthe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks downa hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood whichbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sunplaying upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflectioninto every face so that they all glowed to each other like red menand all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shotfrom the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from themouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon hiscrooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it againand again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again andagain sent it into the whalepull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whalerelaxed in his wrath pull upclose to and the boat ranged alongthe fishs flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churnedhis long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefullychurning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some goldwatch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful ofbreaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought wasthe innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for startingfrom his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry themonster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself inimpenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craftinstantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out fromthat phrensied twilight into the clear air of the dayand now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out intoview surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contractinghis spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at lastgush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple leesof red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again randripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had bursthes dead mr stubb said daggooyes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouthstubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stoodthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had madechapter 62 the darta word concerning an incident in the last chapteraccording to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushesoff from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporarysteersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremostoar the one known as the harpooneeroar now it needs a strongnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in whatis called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to thedistance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhaustingthe chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to theuttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhumanactivity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeatedloud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at thetop of ones compass while all the other muscles are strained and halfstartedwhat that is none know but those who have tried it for one icannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the sametime in this straining bawling state then with his back to thefish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the excitingcrystand up and give it to him he now has to drop and secure hisoar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from thecrotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch itsomehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemenin a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five aresuccessful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursedand disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst theirbloodvessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen areabsent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many shipowners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer thatmakes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how canyou expect to find it there when most wantedagain if the dart be successful then at the second critical instantthat is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneerlikewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy ofthemselves and every one else it is then they change places and theheadsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his properstation in the bows of the boatnow i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is bothfoolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bows fromfirst to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and norowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstancesobvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve aslight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in variouswhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vastmajority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been somuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of theharpooneer that has caused themto insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers of thisworld must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from outof toilchapter 63 the crotchout of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so inproductive subjects grow the chaptersthe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mentionit is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in lengthwhich is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near thebow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity ofthe harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from theprow thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler whosnatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings hisrifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing inthe crotch respectively called the first and second ironsbut these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected withthe line the object being this to dart them both if possible oneinstantly after the other into the same whale so that if in thecoming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold itis a doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing tothe instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale uponreceiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneerhowever lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron intohim nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with theline and the line is running hence that weapon must at all eventsbe anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere elsethe most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into thewater it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box linementioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instancesprudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattendedwith the saddest and most fatal casualtiesfurthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrownoverboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terrorskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the linesor cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directionsnor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale isfairly captured and a corpseconsider now how it must be in

related here the strongest and mostreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongsideis by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part isrelatively heavier than any other excepting the sidefins itsflexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surfaceso that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order toput the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome asmall strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer endand a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the shipby adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other sideof the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readilymade to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at lastlocked fast round the

scooped out huge globular pieces ofthe whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of theshark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailablesurface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remainsa part of the universal problem of all things the mark they thus leaveon the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter incountersinking for a screwthough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seafight sharkswill be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks like hungry dogsround a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down everykilled man that is tossed to them and though while the valiantbutchers over the decktable are thus cannibally carving each otherslive meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselled the sharksalso with their jewelhilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving awayunder the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn thewhole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thingthat is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all partiesand though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave shipscrossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handyin case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to bedecently buried and though one or two other like instances might beset down touching the set terms places and

that feeds his lamp andlike stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems sooutlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history andphilosophy of itit is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the rightwhale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded largeprices there also that in henry viiiths time a certain cook of thecourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to beeaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species ofwhale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating themeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and beingwell seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleballs or veal ballsthe old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a greatporpoise grant from the crownthe fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by allhands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him butwhen you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feetlong it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of menlike stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux arenot so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rareold vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famousdoctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedinglyjuicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen wholong ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vesselthatthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps ofwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber amongthe dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeedthey greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling somethinglike old amsterdam housewives doughnuts or olycooks when freshthey have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger canhardly keep his hands offbut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is hisexceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to bedelicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as thebuffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solidpyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy thatis like the transparent halfjellied white meat of a cocoanut in thethird month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute forbutter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it intosome other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watchesof the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip theirshipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile manya good supper have i thus madein the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a finedish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the twoplump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two largepuddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a mostdelectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which isquite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some youngbucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves brains byand by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able totell a calfs head from their own heads which indeed requiresuncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck withan intelligent looking calfs head before him is somehow one of thesaddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully athim with an et tu brute expressionit is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessivelyunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him withabhorrence that appears to result in some way from the considerationbefore mentioned ie that a man should eat a newly murdered thingof the sea and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first manthat ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he washung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly wouldhave been and he certainly deserved

shark massacrewhen in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long andweary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a generalthing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cuttinghim in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not verysoon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore thecommon usage is to take in all sail lash the helm alee and then sendevery one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservationthat until that time anchorwatches shall be kept that is two andtwo for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deckto see that all goes wellbut sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan willnot answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gatherround the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on astretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning inmost other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not solargely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerablydiminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whalingspades aprocedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems totickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in thepresent case with the pequods sharks though to be sure any manunaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that nightwould have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese andthose sharks the maggots in itnevertheless upon stubb setting the anchorwatch after his supper wasconcluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman cameon deck no small excitement was created among the sharks forimmediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and loweringthree lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbidsea these two mariners darting their long whalingspades kept up anincessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deepinto their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamyconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could notalways hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of theincredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only ateach others disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round andbit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over againby the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor wasthis all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of thesecreatures a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk intheir very joints and bones

answered by ahelping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snapis heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards fromthe whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after itthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now asthe blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orangeso is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimesstripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by thewindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in thewater and as the blubber in one strip

and is all ready forlowering the heavers forward now resume their song and while the onetackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the otheris slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through themain hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called theblubberroom into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keepcoiling away the long blanketpiece as if it were a great live mass ofplaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoistingand lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving theheavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the matesscarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally byway of assuaging the general frictionchapter 68 the blanketi have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skinof the whale i have had controversies about it with experiencedwhalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinionremains unchanged but it is only an opinionthe question is what and where is the skin of the whale already youknow what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistenceof firm closegrained beef but tougher more elastic and compact andranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thicknessnow however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of anycreatures skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yetin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumptionbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from thewhales body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layerof any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skintrue from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off withyour hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhatresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost asflexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when itnot only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle ihave several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whalebooksit is transparent as i said before and being laid upon the printedpage i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted amagnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whalesthrough their own spectacles as you may say but what i am driving athere is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which iadmit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to beregarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so tospeak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin ofthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of anewborn child but no more of thisassuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skinas in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of onehundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantityor rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only threefourths and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hencebe had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whosemere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning tenbarrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only threequarters of the stuff of the whales skinin life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least amongthe many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all overobliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks inthick array something like those in the finest italian lineengravings but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon theisinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it asif they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in someinstances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in averitable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineationsthese are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cypherson the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word touse in the present connexion by my retentive memory of thehieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular i was much struckwith a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on thefamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippilike those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remainsundecipherable this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of anotherthing besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the spermwhale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especiallyhis flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance byreason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular randomaspect i should say that those new england rocks on the seacoastwhich agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contactwith vast floating icebergsi should say that those rocks must not alittle resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to methat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contactwith other whales for i have most remarked them in the largefullgrown bulls of the speciesa word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of thewhale it has already been said that it is stript from him in longpieces called blanketpieces like most seaterms this one is veryhappy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubberas in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian ponchoslipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason ofthis cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keephimself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tideswhat would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icyseas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true otherfish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters butthese be it observed are your coldblooded lungless fish whose verybellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under thelee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an innfire whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze hisblood and he dies how wonderful is it thenexcept afterexplanationthat this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is asindispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found athome immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters where whenseamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwardsperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly isfound glued in amber but more surprising is it to know as has beenproved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer thanthat of a borneo negro in summerit does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strongindividual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rarevirtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyselfafter the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou toolive in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keepthy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peters andlike the great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature ofthine ownbut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things of erectionshow few are domed

other ghosts thanthe cocklane one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believein themchapter 70 the sphynxit should not have been omitted that previous to completely strippingthe body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of thesperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experiencedwhale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reasonconsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neckon the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in thatvery place is the thickest part of him remember also that thesurgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet interveningbetween him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in adiscoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bearin mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cutmany feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner withoutso much as getting one single peep into the evercontracting gash thusmade he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted partsand exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertioninto the skull do you not marvel then at stubbs boast that hedemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whalewhen first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by acable till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a smallwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with afull grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whales headembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspendsuch a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler thiswere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellersscalesthe pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped the headwas hoisted against the

beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not thesmallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicatein mindchapter 71 the jeroboams storyhand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster thanthe ship and soon the pequod began to rockby and by through the glass the strangers boats and manned mastheadsproved her a whaleship but as she was so far to windward andshooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground thepequod could not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see whatresponse would be madehere be it said that like the vessels of military marines the shipsof the american whale fleet have each a private signal all whichsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respectivevessels attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whalecommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even atconsiderable distances and with no small facilitythe pequods signal was at last responded to by the strangers settingher own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucketsquaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequods leeand lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the sideladder wasbeing rigged by starbucks order to accommodate the visiting captainthe stranger in question waved his hand from his boats stern in tokenof that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that thejeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew hercaptain was fearful of infecting the pequods company for thoughhimself and boats crew remained untainted and though his ship washalf a rifleshot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling andflowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantineof the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact withthe pequodbut this did by no means prevent all communications preserving aninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship the jeroboamsboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel tothe pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time itblew very fresh with her maintopsail aback though indeed at timesby the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushedsome way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her properbearings again subject to this and other the like interruptions nowand then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but atintervals not without still another interruption of a very differentsortpulling an oar in the jeroboams boat was a man of a singularappearance even in that wild whaling life where individualnotabilities make up all totalities he was a small short youngishman sprinkled all over his face with freckles and wearing redundantyellow hair a longskirted cabalisticallycut coat of a faded walnuttinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up onhis wrists a deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyesso soon as this figure had been first descried stubb hadexclaimedthats he thats hethe longtogged scaramouch thetownhos company told us of stubb here alluded to a strange storytold of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some timeprevious when the pequod spoke the townho according to this accountand what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch inquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in thejeroboam his story was thishe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeunashakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secretmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of atrapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which hecarried in his vestpocket but which instead of containinggunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strangeapostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucketwhere with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steadycommonsense exterior and offered himself as a greenhand candidatefor the jeroboams whaling voyage they engaged him but straightwayupon the ships getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out ina freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commandedthe captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby heset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea andvicargeneral of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with whichhe declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleeplessexcited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of realdelirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority ofthe ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover theywere afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practicaluse in the ship especially as he refused to work except when hepleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him butapprised that that individuals intention was to land him in the firstconvenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals andvialsdevoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition incase this intention was carried out so strongly did he work upon hisdisciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to thecaptain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship not a man ofthem would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan norwould they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what hewould so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom ofthe ship the consequence of all this was that the archangel caredlittle or nothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic hadbroken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that theplague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it bestayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors mostly poordevils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience tohis instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a godsuch things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are truenor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to themeasureless selfdeception of the fanatic himself as his measurelesspower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time toreturn to the pequodi fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captainmayhew who stood in the boats stern come on boardbut now gabriel started to his feetthink think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horribleplaguegabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but thatinstant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethingsdrowned all speechhast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat driftedbackthink think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk beware of thehorrible taili tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as ifdragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while asuccession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasionalcaprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime thehoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violently and gabriel wasseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangelnature seemed to warrantwhen this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark storyconcerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions fromgabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemedleagued with himit seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speakinga whaleship her people were reliably apprised of the existence ofmoby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in thisintelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking thewhite whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibberinginsanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than theshaker god incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when someyear or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from themastheads macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter himand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have theopportunity despite all the archangels denunciations andforewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boatwith them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and manyperilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting one ironfast meantime gabriel ascending to the mainroyal masthead wastossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies ofspeedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity now whilemacey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all thereckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon thewhale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo abroad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motiontemporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen nextinstant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodilyinto the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the seaat the distance of about fifty yards not a chip of the boat washarmed nor a hair of any oarsmans head but the mate for ever sankit is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in thespermwhale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as anysometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilatedoftener the boats bow is knocked off or the thighboard in which theheadsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body butstrangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than onewhen the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence isdiscernible the man being stark deadthe whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainlydescried from the ship raising a piercing shriekthe vial the vialgabriel called off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunting ofthe whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with addedinfluence because his credulous disciples believed that he hadspecifically foreannounced it instead of only making a generalprophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit oneof many marks in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terrorto the shipmayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to himthat the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether heintended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to whichahab answeredaye straightway then gabriel once more started tohis feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed withdownward pointed fingerthink think of the blasphemerdead and downtherebeware of the blasphemers endahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have justbethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for one of thyofficers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bagevery whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for variousships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addresseddepends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceansthus most letters never reach their mark and many are only receivedafter attaining an age of two or three years or moresoon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorelytumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould inconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such aletter death himself might well have been the postboycanst not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye its buta dim scrawlwhats this as he was studying it out starbuck took along cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split the end toinsert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat withoutits coming any closer to the shipmeantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr haryes mr harryawomans pinny handthe mans wife ill wagerayemr harry maceyship jeroboamwhy its macey and hes deadpoor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but letme have itnay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon goingthat waycurses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now toreceive it and taking the fatal missive from starbucks hands hecaught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards theboat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowingthe boat drifted a little towards the ships stern so that as if bymagic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriels eager hand heclutched it in an instant seized the boatknife and impaling theletter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahabsfeet then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with theiroars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from thepequodas after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacketof the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wildaffairchapter 72 the monkeyropein the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whalethere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now handsare wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is nostaying in any one place for at one and the same time everything hasto be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors thedescription of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it wasmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back theblubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by thespades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as thatsame hook get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by myparticular friend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer todescend upon the monsters back for the special purpose referred tobut in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shallremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation isconcluded the whale be it observed lies almost entirely submergedexcepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some tenfeet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders abouthalf on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves likea treadmill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figuredin the highland costumea shirt and socksin which to my eyes atleast he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a betterchance to observe him as will presently be seenbeing the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoarin his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty toattend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the deadwhales back you have seen italian organboys holding a dancingape bya long cord just so from the ships steep side did i hold queequegdown there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery amonkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round hiswaistit was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before weproceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast at bothends fast to queequegs broad canvas belt and fast to my narrowleather one so that for better or for worse we two for the timewere wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then bothusage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it shoulddrag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligatureunited us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could iany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bondentailedso strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation thenthat while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly toperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stockcompany of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and thatanothers mistake or misfortune might plunge

strongestpossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of hismonkeyrope holderi have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between thewhale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from the incessantrolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardyhe was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during thenight the sharks now freshly and more

take that and run along with ye tothe lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mrstarbuck it is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on awhaleenough replied starbuck only dont hit him again butoh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something ofthat sort and this fellows a weazel what were you about sayingsironly this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyselfwhen stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and asort of teacaddy in the other the first contained strong spirits andwas handed to queequeg the second was aunt charitys gift and thatwas freely given to the waveschapter 73 stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talkover himit must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whalesprodigious head hanging to the pequods side but we must let itcontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend toit for the present other matters press and the best we can do now forthe head is to pray heaven the tackles may holdnow during the past night and forenoon the pequod had graduallydrifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow britgave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of theleviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurkinganywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture ofthose inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned tocruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them nearthe crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale hadbeen brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all theannouncement was made that a right whale should be captured that dayif opportunity offerednor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and twoboats stubbs and flasks were detached in pursuit pulling furtherand further away they at last became almost invisible to the men atthe masthead but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap oftumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one orboth the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were inplain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by thetowing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at firstit seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in amaelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared fromview as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from theship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of beingbrought with a deadly dash against the vessels side but having plentyof line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly theypaid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all theirmight so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the strugglewas intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightenedline in one direction and still plied their oars in another thecontending strain threatened to take them under but it was only a fewfeet advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they didgain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightningalong the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the shipsuddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and soflinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of brokenglass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and oncemore the boats were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speedand blindly altering his course went round the stern of the shiptowing the two boats after him so that they performed a completecircuitmeantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till closeflanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lanceand thus round and round the pequod the battle went while themultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whales bodyrushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at everynew gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountainsthat poured from the smitten rockat last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit heturned upon his back a corpsewhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukesand in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing someconversation ensued between themi wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard saidstubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with soignoble a leviathanwants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boats bowdid you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whaleshead hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a rightwhales on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship cannever afterwards capsizewhy noti dont know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying soand he seems to know all about ships charms but i sometimes thinkhell charm the ship to no good at last i dont half like that chapstubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carvedinto a snakes head stubbsink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of adark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by lookdown there flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of bothhandsaye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil indisguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having beenstowed away on board ship hes the devil i say the reason why youdont see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carriesit coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think ofit hes always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his bootshe sleeps in his boots dont he he hasnt got any hammock but iveseen him lay of nights in a coil of riggingno doubt and its because of his cursed tail he coils it down do yesee in the eye of the riggingwhats the old man have so much to do with him forstriking up a swap or a bargain i supposebargainabout whatwhy do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale andthe devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap awayhis silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and thenhell surrender moby dickpooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do thati dont know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wickedone i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the oldflagship once switching his tail about devilish easy andgentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well hewas at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switchinghis hoofs up and says i want john what for says the oldgovernor what business is that of yours says the devil gettingmadi want to use him take him says the governorand by thelord flask if the devil didnt give john the asiatic cholera beforehe got through with him ill eat this whale in one mouthful but looksharpaint you all ready there well then pull ahead and lets getthe whale alongsidei think i remember some such story as you were telling said flaskwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burdentowards the ship but i cant remember wherethree spaniards adventures of those three bloodyminded soldadoesdid ye read it there flask i guess ye didno never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell mestubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now wasthe same you say is now on board the pequodam i the same man that helped kill this whale doesnt the devil livefor ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see anyparson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has alatchkey to get into the admirals cabin dont you suppose he cancrawl into a porthole tell me that mr flaskhow old do you suppose fedallah is stubbdo you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well thatsthe figure one now take all the hoops in the pequods hold and stringalong in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well thatwouldnt begin to be fedallahs age nor all the coopers in creationcouldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enoughbut see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that youmeant to give fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chance now ifhes so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going tolive for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboardtell methatgive him a good ducking anyhowbut hed crawl backduck him again and keep ducking himsuppose he should take it into his head to duck you thoughyes anddrown youwhat theni should like to see him try it id give him such a pair of blackeyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabinagain for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where helives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damnthe devil flask so you suppose im afraid of the devil whos afraidof him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him indoubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnappingpeople aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devilkidnapped hed roast for him theres a governordo you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahabdo i suppose it youll know it before long flask but i am going nowto keep a sharp lookout on him and if i see anything very suspiciousgoing on ill just take him by the nape of his neck and saylookhere beelzebub you dont do it and if he makes any fuss by the lordill make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstanand give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will comeshort off at the stumpdo you see and then i rather guess when hefinds himself docked in that queer fashion hell sneak off without thepoor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legsand what will you do with the tail stubbdo with it sell it for an ox whip when we get homewhat elsenow do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubbmean or not mean here we are at the shipthe boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard sidewhere fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared forsecuring himdidnt i tell you so said flask yes youll soon see this rightwhales head hoisted up opposite that parmacettisin good time flasks saying proved true as before the pequod steeplyleaned over towards the sperm whales head now by the counterpoise ofboth heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you maywell believe so when on one side you hoist in lockes head you goover that way but now on the other side hoist in kants and you comeback again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keeptrimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunderheads overboardand then you will float light and rightin disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside theship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in thecase of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cutoff whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removedand hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached towhat is called the crownpiece but nothing like this in the presentcase had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped asternand the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pairof overburdening panniersmeantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and everand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his ownhand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied hisshadow while if the parsees shadow was there at all it seemed onlyto blend with and lengthen ahabs as the crew toiled on laplandishspeculations were bandied among them concerning all these passingthingschapter 74 the sperm whales headcontrasted viewhere now are two great whales laying their heads together let usjoin them and lay together our ownof the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the rightwhale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whalesregularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the twoextremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the externaldifference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as ahead of each is this moment hanging from the pequods side and as wemay freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across thedeckwhere i should like to know will you obtain a better chance tostudy practical cetology than herein the first place you are struck by the general contrast betweenthese heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is acertain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whales which the rightwhales sadly lacks there is more character in the sperm whales headas you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority tohim in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too thisdignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at thesummit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short heis what the fishermen technically call a greyheaded whalelet us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely the twomost important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of thehead and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if younarrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you wouldfancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to themagnitude of the headnow from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it isplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no morethan he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whaleseyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancy foryourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objectsthrough your ears you would find that you could only command somethirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sightand about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walkingstraight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would notbe able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you frombehind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at thesame time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makesthe front of a manwhat indeed but his eyesmoreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyesare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as toproduce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position ofthe whales eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet ofsolid head which towers between them like a great mountain separatingtwo lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate theimpressions which each independent organ imparts the whale thereforemust see one distinct picture on this side and another distinctpicture on that side while all between must be profound darkness andnothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on theworld from a sentrybox with two joined sashes for his window but withthe whale these two sashes are separately inserted making twodistinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of thewhales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery andto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenesa curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning thisvisual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with ahint so long as a mans eyes are open in the light the act of seeingis involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeingwhatever objects are before him nevertheless any ones experiencewill teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep ofthings at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively andcompletely to examine any two thingshowever large or however smallatone and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by sideand touch each other but if you now come to separate these twoobjects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then inorder to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind tobear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporaryconsciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes inthemselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much morecomprehensive combining and subtle than mans that he can at thesame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one onone side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if hecan then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were ablesimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinctproblems in euclid nor strictly investigated is there anyincongruity in this comparisonit may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that theextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales whenbeset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queerfrights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectlyproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which theirdivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve thembut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are anentire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads forhours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leafwhatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill sowondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye withrespect to their ears this important difference is to be observedbetween the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former hasan external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly coveredover with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from withoutis it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see theworld through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an earwhich is smaller than a hares but if his eyes were broad as the lensof herschels great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches ofcathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper ofhearing not at allwhy then do you try to enlarge your mindsubtilize itlet us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cantover the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascendingby a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it notthat the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern wemight descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach butlet us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are whata really beautiful and chastelooking mouth from floor to ceilinglined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy asbridal satinsbut come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seemslike the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at oneend instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overheadand expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and suchalas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom thesespikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to beholdwhen fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating theresuspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hangingstraight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like aships jibboom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out ofsorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of hisjaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight areproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws uponhimin most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practisedartistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extractingthe ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebonewith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articlesincluding canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhipswith a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were ananchor and when the proper time comessome few days after the otherworkqueequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentistsare set to drawing teeth with a keen cuttingspade queequeg lancesthe gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle beingrigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen dragstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generallyfortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayednor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawninto slabs and piled away like joists for building houseschapter 75 the right whales headcontrasted viewcrossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the rightwhales headas in general shape the noble sperm whales head may be compared to aroman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadlyrounded so at a broad view the right whales head bears a ratherinelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe two hundredyears ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of ashoemakers last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of thenursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably belodged she and all her progenybut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume differentaspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summitand look at these two fshaped spoutholes you would take the wholehead for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles the apertures inits soundingboard then again if you fix your eye upon this strangecrested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis greenbarnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and thesouthern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyessolely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oakwith a birds nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch thoselive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almostsure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by thetechnical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you willtake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually adiademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together forhim in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is avery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lowerlip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout bycarpenters measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep asulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and morea great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelippedthe fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during animportant interval was sailing down the peruvian coast whenearthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slipperythreshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i atmackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam goodlord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feethigh and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regularridgepole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present uswith those wondrous half vertical scimetarshaped slats of whalebonesay three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of thehead or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewherebeen cursorily mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed withhairy fibres through which the right whale strains the water and inwhose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goesthrough the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds ofbone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curiousmarks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate thecreatures age as the age of an oak by its circular rings though thecertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has thesavor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it wemust grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glancewill seem reasonablein old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fanciesconcerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrouswhiskers inside of the whales mouth another hogs bristles athird old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant languagethere are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of hisupper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouththis reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker orrather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on theupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tuftsimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemncountenanceas every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskersblinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks andother stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand haslong been on the decline it was in queen annes time that the bone wasin its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as thoseancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale asyou may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do wenowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being atent spread over the same bonebut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment andstanding in the right whales mouth look around you afresh seeing allthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you notthink you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon itsthousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softestturkeythe tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of themouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoistingit on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance ishould say it was a sixbarreler that is it will yield you about thatamount of oilere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i startedwiththat the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirelydifferent heads to sum up then in the right whales there is nogreat well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandibleof a lower jaw like the sperm whales nor in the sperm whale arethere any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcelyanything of a tongue again the right whale has two externalspoutholes the sperm whale only onelook your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yetlie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the otherwill not be very long in followingcan you catch the expression of the sperm whales there it is the samehe died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem nowfaded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairielikeplacidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark theother heads expression see that amazing lower lip pressed byaccident against the vessels side so as firmly to embrace the jawdoes not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practicalresolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been astoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza inhis latter yearschapter 76 the batteringramere quitting for the nonce the sperm whales head i would have youas a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its frontaspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have youinvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself someunexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power maybe lodged there here is a vital point for you must eithersatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain aninfidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true eventsperhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded historyyou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whalethe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to thewater you observe that the lower part of that front slopesconsiderably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the longsocket which receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe that themouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed asthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover youobserve that the whale has no external nose and that what nose hehashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that his eyesand ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entirelength from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that thefront of the sperm whales head is a dead blind wall without a singleorgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you arenow to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping partof the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone andnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to thefull cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass isas one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its contentspartly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprisedof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all thatapparent effeminacy in some previous place i have described to you howthe blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orangejust so with the head but with this difference about the head thisenvelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimableby any man who has not handled it the severest pointed harpoon thesharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently reboundsfrom it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were pavedwith horses hoofs i do not think that any sensation lurks in itbethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamenchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do thesailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of comingcontact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they holdthere a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest andtoughest of oxhide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam whichwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowbars byitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at butsupplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that asordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in themcapable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whaleas far as i know has no such provision in him considering too theotherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his headaltogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevatedout of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of itsenvelope considering the unique interior of his head it hashypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lungcelledhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown andunsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible toatmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy theirresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable anddestructive of all elements contributesnow mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurablewall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all amass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled woodisby the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallestinsect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all thespecialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in thisexpansive monster when i shall show you some of his moreinconsiderable braining feats i trust you will have renounced allignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though thesperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixedthe atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of youreyebrow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial andsentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamandergiants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincialsthen what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesss veilat laischapter 77 the great heidelburgh tunnow comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you mustknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operateduponregarding the sperm whales head as a solid oblong you may on aninclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the loweris the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper anunctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming theexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of theforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have twoalmost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internalwall of a thick tendinous substancequoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nauticalmathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is asolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by thesteep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of bothsidesthe lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb ofoil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousandinfiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its wholeextent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the greatheidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce ismystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead formsinnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of hiswondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenishedwith the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tunof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oilyvintages namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely purelimpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance foundunalloyed in any other part of the creature though in life it remainsperfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soonbegins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as whenthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whalescase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though fromunavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks anddribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklishbusiness of securing what you cani know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun wascoated within but in superlative richness that coating could notpossibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane likethe lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the spermwhales caseit will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whaleembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and sinceashas been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one third of the wholelength of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feetfor a good sized whale you have more than twentysix feet for thedepth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against aships sideas in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is broughtclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into thespermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lesta careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastinglylet out its invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of thehead also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained inthat position by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempencombinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in thatquarterthus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous andinthis particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby the spermwhales great heidelburgh tun is tappedchapter 78 cistern and bucketsnimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erectposture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardarm to thepart where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun he has carriedwith him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two partstravelling through a singlesheaved block securing this block so thatit hangs down from the yardarm he swings one end of the rope till itis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then handoverhand downthe other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously helands on the summit of the head therestill high elevated above therest of the company to whom he vivaciously crieshe seems some turkishmuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower ashorthandled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searchesfor the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this businesshe proceeds very heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old housesounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the timethis cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely likea wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while theother end being stretched across the deck is there held by two orthree alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of theindian to whom another person has reached up a very long poleinserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides thebucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the wordto the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling likea dairymaids pail of new milk carefully lowered from its height thefullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quicklyemptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again goes throughthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards theend tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeperand deeper into the tun until some twenty feet of the pole have gonedownnow the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this wayseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at oncea queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wildindian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment hisonehanded hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head orwhether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy orwhether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so withoutstating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is no tellingnow but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket camesuckingly upmy god poor tashtegolike the twin reciprocating bucketin a veritable well dropped headforemost down into this great tun ofheidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out ofsightman overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation firstcame to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one footinto it so as the better to secure his slippery handhold on the whipitself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almostbefore tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime therewas a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the beforelifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the seaas if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was onlythe poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilousdepth to which he had sunkat this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearingthe whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesasharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of allone of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with avast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk shipreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hookupon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to beon the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violentmotions of the headcome down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one handholding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop hewould still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul linerammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that theburied harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted outin heavens name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridgethereavast how will that help him jamming that ironbound bucket ontop of his head avast will yestand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of arocketalmost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enormous massdropped into the sea like niagaras tablerock into the whirlpool thesuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glitteringcopper and all caught their breath as half swingingnow over thesailors heads and now over the waterdaggoo through a thick mist ofspray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poorburiedalive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of thesea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a nakedfigure with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seenhovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that mybrave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to theside and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed momentand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some handsnow jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from theshipha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perchoverhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrustupright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrustforth from the grass over a graveboth bothit is bothcried daggoo again with a joyful shout andsoon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand andwith the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into thewaiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego waslong in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisknow how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after theslowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made sidelunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there thendropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwardsand so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon firstthrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that thatwas not as it ought to be and might occasion great troublehe hadthrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought asomerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth inthe good old wayhead foremost as for the great head itself that wasdoing as well as could be expectedand thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics ofqueequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego wassuccessfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward andapparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to beforgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencingand boxing riding and rowingi know that this queer adventure of the gayheaders will be sure toseem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may haveeither seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore anaccident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too thanthe indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of thesperm whales wellbut peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thoughtthe tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest andmost corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element ofa far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not atall but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case hadbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but thedense tendinous wall of the wella double welded hammered substanceas i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump ofwhich sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinkingin this substance was in the present instance materially counteractedby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that itsank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fairchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may sayyes it was a running delivery so it wasnow had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very preciousperishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of

head andsweetly perished therechapter 79 the prairieto scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of thisleviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist hasas yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful asfor lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltaror for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of thepantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats ofthe various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces ofhorses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon themodifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and hisdisciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching thephrenological characteristics of other beings than man thereforethough i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application ofthese two semisciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try allthings i achieve what i canphysiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature hehas no proper nose and since the nose is the central and mostconspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies andfinally controls their combined expression hence it would seem thatits entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affectthe countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spirecupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensableto the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically inkeeping without the elevated openwork belfry of the nose dash thenose from phidiass marble jove and what a sorry remaindernevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all hisproportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in thesculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it isan added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent ason your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in yourjollyboat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by thereflection that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit whichso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiestroyal beadle on his thronein some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view tobe had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head thisaspect is sublimein thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with themorning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull hasa touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defilesthe elephants brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow isas that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to theirdecrees it signifiesgod done this day by my hand but in mostcreatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere stripof alpine land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads whichlike shakespeares or melancthons rise so high and descend so lowthat the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakesand all above them in the foreheads wrinkles you seem to track theantlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunterstrack the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale thishigh and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immenselyamplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel thedeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any otherobject in living nature for you see no one point precisely not onedistinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no facehe has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of aforehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boatsand ships and men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminishthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so inprofile you plainly perceive that horizontal semicrescenticdepression in the foreheads middle which in man is lavaters markof geniusbut how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written abook spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doingnothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in hispyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whalebeen known to the young orient world he would have been deified bytheir childmagian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nilebecause the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongueor at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable ofprotrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shalllure back to their birthright the merry mayday gods of old andlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the nowunhaunted hill then be sure exalted to joves high seat the greatsperm whale shall lord itchampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there isno champollion to decipher the egypt of every mans and every beingsface physiognomy like every other human science is but a passingfable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages couldnot read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtlemeanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee ofthe sperm whales brow i but put that brow before you read it if youcanchapter 80 the nutif the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologisthis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible tosquarein the fullgrown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feetin length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is asthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a levelbase but in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane isangularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbentmass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater tobed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this craterinanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many indepthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain the brain is atleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden awaybehind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within theamplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casket is itsecreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily denythat the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblanceof one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine lying instrange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions itseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard thatmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligenceit is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan inthe creatures living intact state is an entire delusion as for histrue brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any thewhale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to thecommon worldif you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear viewof its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by itsresemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and fromthe same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled downto the human magnitude among a plate of mens skulls and you wouldinvoluntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions onone part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would saythis manhad no selfesteem and no veneration and by those negationsconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk andpower you can best form to yourself the truest though not the mostexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency isbut if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain youdeem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another ideafor you if you attentively regard almost any quadrupeds spine youwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strungnecklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to theskull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebræ are absolutelyundeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it thegermans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend oncepointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and withthe vertebræ of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo thebeaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists haveomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from thecerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a manscharacter will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feelyour spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spinenever yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as inthe firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to theworldapply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranialcavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebrathe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across beingeight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards asit passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size butfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of coursethis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethespinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain andwhat is still more for many feet after emerging from the brainscavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equalto that of the brain under all these circumstances would it beunreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologicallyfor viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of hisbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparativemagnitude of his spinal cordbut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists iwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to thesperm whales hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over oneof the larger vertebræ and is therefore in some sort the outerconvex mould of it from its relative situation then i should callthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the spermwhale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet havereason to knowchapter 81 the pequod meets the virginthe predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrauderick de deer master of bremenat one time

mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at allheeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the germansoon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediatelyturning

flyingfish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding byhinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technicallycalled a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the nameof jungfrau or the virginhis necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained hisships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from themastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick thatwithout pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewedround his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeedersnow the game having risen to leeward he and the other three germanboats that soon followed him had considerably the start of thepequods keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of theirdanger they were going all abreast with great speed straight beforethe wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses inharness they left a great wide wake as though continually unrollinga great wide parchment upon the seafull in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a hugehumped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well asby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemedafflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether thiswhale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it isnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all socialnevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back watermust have retarded him because the whitebone or swell at his broadmuzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostilecurrents meet his spout was short slow and

hisforeign rivals the only thing they feared was that from beingalready so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his ironbefore they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick

the germansquarter an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in thewhales immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides wasthe foaming swell that he madeit was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale wasnow going head out and sending his spout before him in a continualtormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony offright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his falteringflight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sankin the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin sohave i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circlesin the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the birdhas a voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but thefear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchantedin him he had no voice save that choking respiration through hisspiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable whilestill in his amazing bulk

allthree tigersqueequeg tashtego daggooinstinctively sprang to theirfeet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed theirbarbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their

brief one giving a sudden gasp hetumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew roundthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in themwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding wouldsoon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might theycaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till atlastowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks ofthe boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the bluethegunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the threesterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound forsome time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending moreline though the position was a little ticklish but though boats havebeen taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on asit is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh fromthe back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon risingagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of theperil of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is alwaysthe best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer thestricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted becauseowing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whalesomething less than 2000 square feetthe pressure of the water isimmense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight weourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air howvast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of twohundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fiftyatmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twentylineofbattle ships with all their guns and stores and men onboardas the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing downinto its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of anysort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depthswhat landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence andplacidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching inagony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bowsseems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathanwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended andto what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it wasonce so triumphantly

surface must have been long enough and broadenough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to thewounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his headstand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenlyvibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as bymagnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that everyoarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great partfrom the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounceupwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears arescared from it into the seahaul in haul in cried starbuck again hes risingthe lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadthcould have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back alldripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within twoships lengths of the huntershis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most landanimals there are certain valves or floodgates in many of their veinswhereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantlyshut off in certain directions not so with the whale one of whosepeculiarities it is to have an entire nonvalvular structure of thebloodvessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as aharpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterialsystem and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure ofwater at a great distance below the surface his life may be said topour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity ofblood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains thathe will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period evenas in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the wellspringsof faroff and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulledupon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and thelances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from thenew made wound which kept continually playing while the naturalspouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sendingits affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yetcame because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his lifeas they significantly call it was untouchedas the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part ofhis form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainlyrevealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been werebeheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of thenoblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whales eyeshad once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to seebut pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and hisblind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in

thatbut humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart anulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into morethan sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swiftfury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their gloryingcrews all over with showers of gore capsizing flasks boat and marringthe bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was heby loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he hadmade lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped finthen over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up thewhite secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was mostpiteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water isgradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifledmelancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to thegroundso the last long dying spout of the whalesoon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the bodyshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifledimmediately by starbucks orders lines were secured to it atdifferent points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunkenwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by veryheedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferredto her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffestflukechains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld thebody would at once sink to the bottomit so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spadethe entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in hisflesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as thestumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of capturedwhales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominenceof any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs havebeen some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account forthe ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of alancehead of stone being found in him not far from the buried ironthe flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance andwhen it might have been darted by some nor west indian long beforeamerica was discoveredwhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrouscabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to furtherdiscoveries by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sidewaysto the sea owing to the bodys immensely increasing tendency to sinkhowever starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it tothe last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length theship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms withthe body then when the command was given to break clear from it suchwas the immovable strain upon the timberheads to which theflukechains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to castthem off meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to theother side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of ahouse the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of herbulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnaturaldislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon theimmovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and solow had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be atall approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemedadded to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of goingoverhold on hold on wont ye cried stubb to the body dont be insuch a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do somethingor go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikesand run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the bigchainsknife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenters heavyhatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashingat the largest flukechains but a few strokes full of sparks weregiven when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrificsnap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sanknow this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed spermwhale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequatelyaccounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with greatbuoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above thesurface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre andbrokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all theirbones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert thatthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish sosinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but itis not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling withnoble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may oflife with all their panting lard about them even these brawnybuoyant heroes do sometimes sinkbe it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to thisaccident than any other species where one of that sort go down twentyright whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputablein no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whalehis venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from thisincumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instanceswhere after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whaleagain rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this isobvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigiousmagnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a lineofbattle shipcould hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundingsamong the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token ofsinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that whenthe body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shallhave ascended againit was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard fromthe pequods mastheads announcing that the jungfrau was againlowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of afinback belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because ofits incredible power of swimming nevertheless the finbacks spout isso similar to the sperm whales that by unskilful fishermen it isoften mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host werenow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding allsail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappearedfar to leeward still in bold hopeful chaseoh many are the finbacks and many are the dericks my friendchapter 82 the honor and glory of whalingthere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is thetrue methodthe more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my

the first whaleman and tothe eternal honor of our calling be it said that the first whaleattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intentthose were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore armsto succor the distressed and not to fill mens lampfeeders every oneknows the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovelyandromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoastand as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off perseus theprince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster anddelivered and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploitrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch asthis leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubtthis arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syriancoast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vastskeleton of a whale which the citys legends and all the inhabitantsasserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slewwhen the romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy intriumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in thisstory is this it was from joppa that jonah set sailakin to the adventure of perseus and andromedaindeed by some supposedto be indirectly derived from itis that famous story of st george andthe dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in manyold chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together andoften stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as adragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale intruth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides itwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george butencountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battlewith the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but onlya perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to marchboldly up to a whalelet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though thecreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguelyrepresented of a griffinlike shape and though the battle is depictedon land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignoranceof those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artistsand considering that as in perseus case st georges whale might havecrawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animalridden by st george might have been only a large seal or seahorsebearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatiblewith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene tohold this socalled dragon no other than the great leviathan himselfin fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole storywill fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistinesdagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horseshead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only thestump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noblestamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and bygood rights we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the mostnoble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of thathonorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to dowith a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketerwith disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers weare much better entitled to st georges decoration than theywhether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i longremained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies thatantique crockett and kit carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing gooddeeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether thatstrictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhereappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed fromthe inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntarywhaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale iclaim him for one of our clanbut by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story ofhercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still moreancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versâ certainlythey are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not theprophetnor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the wholeroll of our order our grand master is still to be named for likeroyal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity innothing short of the great gods themselves that

vishnoo theres amemberroll for you what club but the whalemans can head off likethatchapter 83 jonah historically regardedreference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale inthe preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust thishistorical story of jonah and the whale but then there were somesceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagansof their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whaleand arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions didnot make those traditions one whit the less facts for all thatone old sagharbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the hebrewstory was thishe had one of those quaint oldfashioned biblesembellished with curious unscientific plates one of which representedjonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarity only true withrespect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and thevarieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have thissaying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very smallbut to this bishop jebbs anticipative answer is ready it is notnecessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in thewhales belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth andthis seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the rightwhales mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables andcomfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might haveensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the rightwhale is toothlessanother reason which sagharbor he went by that name urged for hiswant of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely inreference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices butthis objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetistsupposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of adead whaleeven as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turnedtheir dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it hasbeen divined by other continental commentators that when jonah wasthrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected hisescape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for afigurehead and i would add possibly called the whale as somecraft are nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle norhave there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that thewhale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a lifepreserveraninflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so wassaved from a watery doom poor sagharbor therefore seems worsted allround but he had still another reason for his want of faith it wasthis if i remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in themediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewherewithin three days journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very muchmore than three days journey across from the nearest point of themediterranean coast how is thatbut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet withinthat short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round bythe way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passagethrough the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage upthe persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve thecomplete circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak ofthe tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for anywhale to swim in besides this idea of jonahs weathering the cape ofgood hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery ofthat great headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer andso make modern history a liarbut all these foolish arguments of old sagharbor only evinced hisfoolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him seeingthat he had but little learning except what he had picked up from thesun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride andabominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by aportuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonahs going to ninevehvia the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of thegeneral miracle and so it was besides to this day the highlyenlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonahand some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harrissvoyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in whichmosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oilchapter 84 pitchpolingto make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages areanointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform ananalogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is itto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possiblybe of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water arehostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is tomake the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointinghis boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfraudisappeared took more than customary pains in that occupationcrawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing inthe unctuousness as though diligently seeking

greatexertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but thestricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontalflight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon theplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it becameimperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but tohaul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast andfurious what then remainedof all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand andcountless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forcednone exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling smallsword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it itis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand factand feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance isaccurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extremeheadway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten ortwelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of theharpoon and also of a lighter materialpine it is furnished with asmall rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can behauled back to the hand after dartingbut before going further it is important to mention here that thoughthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it isseldom done and when done is still less frequently successful onaccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon ascompared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as ageneral thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale beforeany pitchpoling comes into playlook now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness andequanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excelin

fountainthat for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions of agesbeforethe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea andsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so manysprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries backthousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of thewhale watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all this shouldbe and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarterminutes past one oclock pm of this sixteenth day of december ad1851 it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings areafter all really water or nothing but vaporthis is surely anoteworthy thinglet us then look at this matter along with some interesting itemscontingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of theirgills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all timesis combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or acod might live a century and never once raise its head above thesurface but owing to his marked internal structure which gives himregular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live byinhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore thenecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannotin any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitudethe sperm whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath thesurface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with hismouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on thetop of his headif i say that in any creature breathing is only a functionindispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air acertain element which being subsequently brought into contact with theblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think ishall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific wordsassume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could beaerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and notfetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would thenlive without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely thecase with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his fullhour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath orso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he hasno gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spinehe is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth ofvermicellilike vessels which vessels when he quits the surface arecompletely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour ormore a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock ofvitality in him just as the camel crossing the waterless desertcarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its foursupplementary stomachs the anatomical fact of this labyrinth isindisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonableand true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwiseinexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings outas the fishermen phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested uponrising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a periodof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings say hestays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventybreaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have hisseventy breaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a fewbreaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging upagain to make good his regular allowance of air and not till thoseseventy breaths are told will he finally go down to stay out his fullterm below remark however that in different individuals these ratesare different but in any one they are alike now why should the whalethus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenishhis reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it toothat this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatalhazards of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vastleviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath thesunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the greatnecessities that strike the victory to theein man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only serving fortwo or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has toattend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but thesperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his timeit has been said that the whale only breathes through his spoutholeif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with waterthen i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense ofsmell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that atall answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being soclogged with two elements it could not be expected to have the powerof smelling but owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be wateror whether it be vaporno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived aton this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has noproper olfactories but what does he want of them no roses noviolets no colognewater in the seafurthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spoutingcanal and as that long canallike the grand erie canalis furnishedwith a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention ofair or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voiceunless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles hetalks through his nose but then again what has the whale to sayseldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to thisworld unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting aliving oh happy that the world is such an excellent listenernow the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as it isfor the conveyance of air and for several feet laid alonghorizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a littleto one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid downin a city on one side of a street but the question returns whetherthis gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spoutof the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whetherthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth anddischarged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouthindirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot beproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through thespiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to bewhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the sperm whalesfood is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if hewould besides if you regard him very closely and time him with yourwatch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviatingrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods ofrespirationbut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak outyou have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you nottell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy tosettle these plain things i have ever found your plain things theknottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost standin it and yet be undecided as to what it is preciselythe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist envelopingit and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from itwhen always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close viewof his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading allaround him and if at such times you should think that you reallyperceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they arenot merely condensed from its vapor or how do you know that they arenot those identical drops superficially lodged in the spoutholefissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head foreven when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm withhis elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even thenthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under ablazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up withrainnor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching theprecise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peeringinto it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher tothis fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming intoslight contact with the outer vapory shreds of the jet which willoften happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness ofthe thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closercontact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view orotherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and armwherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try toevade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubtit that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blindyou the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me isto let this deadly spout alonestill we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish myhypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besidesother reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerationstouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale iaccount him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputedfact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all otherwhales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i amconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such asplato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goesup a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deepthoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had thecuriosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflectedthere a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere overmy head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deepthought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of anaugust noon this seems an additional argument for the abovesuppositionand how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster tobehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mildhead overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicablecontemplations and that vaporas you will sometimes see itglorifiedby a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughtsfor dye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiatevapor and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in mymind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with aheavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many denybut doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts ofall things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly thiscombination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man whoregards them both with equal eyechapter 86 the tailother poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelopeand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less

of at least fifty square feetthe compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flatpalms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch inthickness at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlapthen sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancybetween in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitelydefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmostexpansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceedtwenty feet acrossthe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cutinto it and you find that three distinct strata compose ituppermiddle and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are longand horizontal those of the middle one very short and runningcrosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much asanything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old romanwalls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thincourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderfulrelics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to thegreat strength of the masonrybut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enoughthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof ofmuscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loinsand running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them andlargely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluentmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a pointcould annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do itnor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple the gracefulflexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through atitanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their mostappalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty orharmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposinglybeautiful strength has much to do with the magic take away

motions are peculiar to it first when used as a fin forprogression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweepingfourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukesfirst being horizontal in its position the leviathans tail acts in adifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it neverwriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to thewhale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scrollwise coiledforwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it isthis which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monsterwhen furiously swimming his sidefins only serve to steer bysecond it is a little significant that while one sperm whale onlyfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in hisconflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail instriking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and theblow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructedair especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simplyirresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your onlysalvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through theopposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of thewhaleboat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or adashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally themost serious result these submerged side blows are so often receivedin the fishery that they are accounted mere childs play some onestrips off a frock and the hole is stoppedthird i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whalethe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respectthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of theelephants trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action ofsweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain softslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface ofthe sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailorwhiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touchhad this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me ofdarmonodes elephant that so frequented the flowermarket and with lowsalutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed theirzones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does notpossess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yetanother elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round histrunk and extracted the dartfourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of themiddle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulenceof his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were ahearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of histail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface thethunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think agreat gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath ofvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think thatthat was the smoke from the touchholefifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukeslie considerably below the level of his back they are then completelyout of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge intothe deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body aretossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till theydownwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breachsomewhereelse to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps thegrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomlessprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at thehighest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrustingforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but ingazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in thedantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah thearchangels standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise thatcrimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the eastall heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert withpeaked flukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodimentof adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home ofthe fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the africanelephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the mostdevout of all beings for according to king juba the militaryelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunksuplifted in the profoundest silencethe chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and theelephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunkof the other are concerned should not tend to place those two oppositeorgans on an equality much less the creatures to which theyrespectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier toleviathan so compared with leviathans tail his trunk is but thestalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephants trunk wereas the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush andcrash of the sperm whales ponderous flukes which in repeatedinstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all theiroars and crews into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses hisballsthough all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale andthe elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular theelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog doesto the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points ofcurious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that theelephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and thenelevating it jet it forth in a streamthe more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore myinability to express it at times there are gestures in it whichthough they would well grace the hand of man remain whollyinexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally arethese mystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared themakin to freemason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by thesemethods intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wantingother motions of the whale in his general body full of strangenessand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how imay then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if iknow not even the tail of this whale how understand his head muchmore how comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see myback parts my tail he seems to say but my

presentday we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which inthose waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillagedwith a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to thesestraits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea andthence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented hereand there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islandsand gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling seasonthere by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almostall the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous todescending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhereelse foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to mobydick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when hemight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting itbut how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land does hiscrew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long timenow the circusrunning sun has raced within his fiery ring and needsno sustenance but whats in himself so ahab mark this too in thewhaler while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to betransferred to

the whaleship in all that interval may not havesighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floatingseamen like themselves so that did you carry them the news thatanother flood had come they would only answerwell boys heres thearknow as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast ofjava in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most ofthe ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as anexcellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more andmore upon java head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed andadmonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of theland soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils thefresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet wasdescried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any gamehereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when thecustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacleof singular magnificence saluted usbut here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity withwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the spermwhales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detachedcompanies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensiveherds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almostseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league andcovenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation ofthe sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed thecircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may nowsometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted bya single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seemsthousands on thousandsbroad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles andforming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon acontinuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in thenoonday air unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the rightwhale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like thecleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout ofthe sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continuallyrising and falling away to leewardseen from the pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill ofthe sea this host of vapory spouts individually curling up into theair and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showedlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descriedof a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a heightas marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountainsaccelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage intheir rear and once more expand in comparative security upon theplain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forwardthrough the straits gradually contracting the wings of theirsemicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centrecrowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneershandling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yetsuspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they thatchased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deployinto the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of theirnumber and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan mobydick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshippedwhiteelephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so withstunsail piled on stunsail we sailed along driving these leviathansbefore us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudlydirecting attention to something in our wakecorresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in ourrear it seemed formed of detached white vapors rising and fallingsomething like the spouts of the whales only they did not socompletely come and go for they constantly hovered without finallydisappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolvedin his pivothole crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets towet the sailsmalays sir and after usas if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod shouldfairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now inhot pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay but when theswift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase howvery kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her onto her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels to her thatthey were as with glass under arm ahab toandfro paced the deck inhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after onethe bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the aboveseemed his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the waterydefile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him thatthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how thatthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to hisdeadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild piratesand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on withtheir curseswhen all these conceits had passed through his brainahabs brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach aftersome stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag thefirm thing from its placebut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew andwhen after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern thepequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatraside emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then theharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had beengaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had sovictoriously gained upon the malays but still driving on in the wakeof the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually theship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed tospring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumedwonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notified of the threekeels that were after themthough as yet a mile in their rearthanthey rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so thattheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets movedon with redoubled velocitystripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash andafter several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce thechase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animatingtoken that they were now at last under the influence of that strangeperplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive itin the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns inwhich they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were nowbroken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants inthe indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad withconsternation in all directions expanding in vast irregular circlesand aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thickspoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this wasstill more strangely evinced by those of their number who completelyparalysed as it were helplessly floated like waterlogged dismantledships on the sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simplesheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could notpossibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasionaltimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures thoughbanding together in tens of thousands the lionmaned buffaloes of thewest have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all humanbeings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatres pitthey will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helterskelter for theoutlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing eachother to death best therefore withhold any amazement at thestrangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beastsof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of menthough many of the whales as has been said were in violent motionyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced norretreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary inthose cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lonewhale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes timequeequegs harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding sprayin our faces and then running away with us like light steeredstraight for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the partof the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wiseunprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipatedyet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of thefishery for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into thefrantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in adelirious throbas blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power ofspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as wethus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew bythe crazed creatures to

it ischiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then morewhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time butsperm whales are not every day encountered while you may

moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moodsyes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at theheart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance webeheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successivepods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and roundlike multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder toshoulder

the wound of this whale and an appallingspectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemedto inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at firstthe intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceivedthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whalehad become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed he had also runaway with the cuttingspade in him and while the free end of the ropeattached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of theharpoonline round his tail the cuttingspade itself had worked loosefrom his

and schoolmastersthe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of spermwhales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing thosevast aggregationsnow though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as musthave been seen even at the present day small detached bands areoccasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals eachsuch bands are known as

gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming aboutover the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces andendearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and hisconcubines is striking because while he is always of the largestleviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not morethan onethird of the bulk of an averagesized male they arecomparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozenyards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon thewhole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon pointit is very curious to watch this

not in strict character howeveradmirably satirical that after going to school himself he should thengo abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of ithis title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from thename bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that theman who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have readthe memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sort of acountryschoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days andwhat was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some ofhis pupilsthe same

sometimes lingering so near her and so long asthemselves to fall a preychapter 89 fastfish and loosefishthe allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but onenecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whalefishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badgeit frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in companya whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killedand captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprisedmany minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature forexampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale thebody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm anddrifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in acalm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus themost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between thefishermen were there not some written or unwritten universalundisputed law applicable to all casesperhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislativeenactment was that of holland it was decreed by the statesgeneral inad 1695 but though no other nation has ever had any written whalinglaw yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators andlawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for tersecomprehensiveness surpasses justinians pandects and the bylaws of thechinese society for the suppression of meddling with other peoplesbusiness yes these laws might be engraven on a queen annes farthingor the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are theyi a fastfish belongs to the party fast to itii a loosefish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch itbut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirablebrevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries toexpound itfirst what is a fastfish alive or dead a fish is technically fastwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium atall controllable by the occupant or occupantsa mast an oar anineinch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all thesame likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or anyother recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing itplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as wellas their intention so to dothese are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalementhemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthecokeuponlittleton of the fist true among the more upright andhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases whereit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claimpossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party butothers are by no means so scrupuloussome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigatedin england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase ofa whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs hadsucceeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril oftheir lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boatitself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came upwith the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated itbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants wereremonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffsteeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he haddone he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which hadremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure whereforethe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whaleline harpoons and boatmr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was thejudge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on toillustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con casewherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifesviciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but inthe course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action torecover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he thensupported it by saying that though the gentleman had originallyharpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason ofthe great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandonedher yet abandon her he did so that she became a loosefish andtherefore when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady thenbecame that subsequent gentlemans property along with whateverharpoon might have been found sticking in hernow in the present case erskine contended that the examples of thewhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each otherthese pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the verylearned judge in set terms decided to witthat as for the boat heawarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it tosave their lives but that with regard to the controverted whaleharpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale becauseit was a loosefish at the time of the final capture and the harpoonsand line because when the fish made off with them it the fishacquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwardstook the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards tookthe fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirsa common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge mightpossibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of thematter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling lawspreviously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough inthe above cited case these two laws touching fastfish and loosefishi say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all humanjurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery ofsculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistineshas but two props to stand onis it not a saying in every ones mouth possession is half of the lawthat is regardless of how the thing came into possession but oftenpossession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls ofrussian serfs and republican slaves but fastfish whereof possessionis the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widowslast mite but a fastfish what is yonder undetected villains marblemansion with a doorplate for a waif what is that but a fastfishwhat is

habeat caput et regina caudambracton l 3 c 3latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with thecontext means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast ofthat land the king as honorary grand harpooneer must have the headand the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a divisionwhich in the whale is much like halving an apple there is nointermediate remainder now as this law under a modified form is tothis day in force in england and as it offers in various respects astrange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loosefish it ishere treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principlethat prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separatecar specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the firstplace in curious proof of the fact that the abovementioned law isstill in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance thathappened within the last two yearsit seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some oneof the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing andbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off fromthe shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under thejurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord wardenholding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royalemoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignmenthis by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not sobecause the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing hisperquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing ofthemnow when these poor sunburnt mariners barefooted and with theirtrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled theirfat fish high and dry promising themselves a good 150 from theprecious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with theirwives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of theirrespective shares up steps a very learned and most christian andcharitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm andlaying it upon the whales head he sayshands off this fish mymasters is a fastfish i seize it as the lord wardens upon thisthe poor mariners in their respectful consternationso trulyenglishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching theirheads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to thestranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften thehard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone atlength one of them after long scratching about for his ideas madebold to speakplease sir who is the lord wardenthe dukebut the duke had nothing to do with taking this fishit is hiswe have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is allthat to go to the dukes benefit we getting nothing at all for ourpains but our blistersit is hisis the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode ofgetting a livelihoodit is hisi thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share ofthis whaleit is hiswont the duke be content with a quarter or a halfit is hisin a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke ofwellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particularlights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree bedeemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergymanof the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him totake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration towhich my lord duke in substance replied both letters were publishedthat he had already done so and received the money and would beobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverendgentleman would decline meddling with other peoples business is thisthe still militant old man standing at the corners of the threekingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggarsit will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duketo the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needsinquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally investedwith that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdongives us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caught belongsto the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by thesoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in suchmattersbut why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reasonfor that ye lawyersin his treatise on queengold or queenpinmoney an old kings benchauthor one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queensthat ye queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now thiswas written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland orright whale was largely used in ladies bodices but this same bone isnot in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for asagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to bepresented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk herethere are two royal fish so styled by the english law writersthe whaleand the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations andnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue iknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter but byinference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the sameway as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic headpeculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly behumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus thereseems a reason in all things even in lawchapter 91 the pequod meets the rosebudin vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of thisleviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry sir t browneveit was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and whenwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory midday sea that themany noses on the pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers thanthe three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smellwas smelt in the seai will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts aresome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought theywould keel up before longpresently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distancelay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale mustbe alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french coloursfrom his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl thatcircled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that thewhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale thatis a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated anunappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odorsuch a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plaguewhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerableindeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them tomoor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do itnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is ofa very inferior quality and by no means of the nature ofattarofrosecoming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchmanhad a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more ofa nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of thoseproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort ofprodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodiesalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in theproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn uphis nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blastedwhales in generalthe pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed herecognised his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that wereknotted round the tail of one of these whalestheres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in theships bows theres a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoesof frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes loweringtheir boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yesand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes oftallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil theywill get wont be enough to dip the captains wick into aye we allknow these things but look ye heres a crappo that is content withour leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content toowith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has therepoor devil i say pass round a hat some one and lets make him apresent of a little oil for dear charitys sake for what oil hell getfrom that drugged whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail nonot in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why ill agree toget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of oursthan hell get from that bundle of bones though now that i think ofit it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yesambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that its worthtrying yes im for it and so saying he started for thequarterdeckby this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whetheror no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hopeof escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabinstubb now called his boats crew and pulled off for the strangerdrawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with thefanciful french taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved inthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and forthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the wholeterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour uponher head boards in large gilt letters he read bouton deroserosebutton or rosebud and this was the romantic name of thisaromatic shipthough stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscriptionyet the word rose and the bulbous figurehead put togethersufficiently explained the whole to hima wooden rosebud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that willdo very well but how like all creation it smellsnow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck hehad to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come closeto the blasted whale and so talk over itarrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose hebawledboutonderose ahoy are there any of you boutonderoses thatspeak englishyes rejoined a guernseyman from the bulwarks who turned out to bethe chiefmatewell then my boutonderosebud have you seen the white whalewhat whalethe white whalea sperm whalemoby dick have ye seen himnever heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whalenovery good then good bye now and ill call again in a minutethen rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaningover the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his twohands into a trumpet and shoutedno sir no upon which ahabretired and stubb returned to the frenchmanhe now perceived that the guernseyman who had just got into thechains and was using a cuttingspade had slung his nose in a sort ofbagwhats the matter with your nose there said stubb broke iti wish it was broken or that i didnt have any nose at all answeredthe guernseyman who did not seem to relish the job he was at verymuch but what are you holding yours foroh nothing its a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day aintit air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies willye boutonderosewhat in the devils name do you want here roared the guernseymanflying into a sudden passionoh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack thosewhales in ice while youre working at em but joking aside though doyou know rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out ofsuch whales as for that dried up one there he hasnt a gill in hiswhole carcasei know that well enough but dye see the captain here wont believeit this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before butcome aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wont me and so illget out of this dirty scrapeanything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubband with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scenepresented itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted weregetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they workedrather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a goodhumor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so manyjibbooms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run upto the masthead to get some fresh air some thinking they would catchthe plague dipped oakum in coaltar and at intervals held it to theirnostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost shortoff at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobaccosmoke so that itconstantly filled their olfactoriesstubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding fromthe captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that direction saw afiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar fromwithin this was the tormented surgeon who after in vainremonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himselfto the captains roundhouse cabinet he called it to avoid thepest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties andindignations at timesmarking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to theguernseyman had a little chat with him during which the stranger mateexpressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus whohad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a picklesounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernseymanhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he thereforeheld his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank andconfidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little planfor both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at alldreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little planof theirs the guernseyman under cover of an interpreters officewas to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb andas for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermostin him during the interviewby this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was asmall and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain withlarge whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvetvest with watchseals at his side to this gentleman stubb was nowpolitely introduced by the guernseyman who at once ostentatiously puton the aspect of interpreting between themwhat shall i say to him first said hewhy said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals youmay as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to methough i dont pretend to be a judgehe says monsieur said the guernseyman in french turning to hiscaptain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captainand chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from ablasted whale they had brought alongsideupon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know morewhat now said the guernseyman to stubbwhy since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed himcarefully im quite certain that hes no more fit to command awhaleship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me hes ababoonhe vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried oneis far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjuresus as we value our lives to cut loose from these fishinstantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded hiscrew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once castloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the shipwhat now said the guernseyman when the captain had returned tothemwhy let me see yes you may as well tell him now thatthatin facttell him ive diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebodyelsehe says monsieur that hes very happy to have been of any service toushearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful partiesmeaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down intohis cabin to drink a bottle of bordeauxhe wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreterthank him heartily but tell him its against my principles to drinkwith the man ive diddled in fact tell him i must gohe says monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinkingbut that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieurhad best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whalesfor its so calm they wont driftby this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailedthe guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in hisboat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out thelighter whale of the two from the ships side while the frenchmansboats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubbbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiouslyslacking out a most unusually long towlinepresently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whalehoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance whilethe pequod slid in between him and stubbs whale whereupon stubbquickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to givenotice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of hisunrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boatspade he commenced anexcavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almosthave thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when atlength his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning upold roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boats crewwere all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and lookingas anxious as goldhuntersand all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking andscreaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginningto look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increasedwhen suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole afaint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smellswithout being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and thenalong with another without at all blending with it for a timei have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking somethingin the subterranean regions a purse a pursedropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls ofsomething that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled oldcheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it withyour thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and thisgood friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to anydruggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidablylost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured wereit not for impatient ahabs loud command to stubb to desist and comeon board else the ship would bid them good byechapter 92 ambergrisnow this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as anarticle of commerce that in 1791 a certain nantucketborn captaincoffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on thatsubject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late daythe precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problemto the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compoundfor grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amberthough at times found on the seacoast is also dug up in some farinland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the seabesides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substanceused for mouthpieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergrisis soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largelyused in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hairpowders andpomatum the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca forthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peters in romesome wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor itwho would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen shouldregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of asick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be thecause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how tocure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administeringthree or four boat loads of brandreths pills and then running out ofharms way as laborers do in blasting rocksi have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergriscertain hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might besailors trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they werenothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that mannernow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should befound in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of thatsaying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruptionhow that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewisecall to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh thebest musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things ofillsavor colognewater in its rudimental manufacturing stages isthe worsti should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal butcannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made againstwhalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased mindsmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been saidof the frenchmans two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderousaspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling isthroughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing torebut they hint that all whales always smell bad now how did thisodious stigma originatei opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of thegreenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago becausethose whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at seaas the southern ships have always done but cutting up the freshblubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casksand carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in thoseicy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposedforbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breakinginto the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in thegreenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arisingfrom excavating an old city graveyard for the foundations of alyingin hospitali partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may belikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in formertimes of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg whichlatter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his greatwork on smells a textbook on that subject as its name importssmeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order toafford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be triedout without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was acollection of furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and when the workswere in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor butall this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in avoyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold withoil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boilingout and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentlessthe truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as aspecies are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen berecognised as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jewin the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly beotherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such highhealth taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though itis true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a spermwhales flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscentedlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken thesperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not beto that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrhwhich was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the greatchapter 93 the castawayit was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a mostsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the pequods crewan event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimesmadly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanyingprophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her ownnow in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boatssome few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it isto work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a generalthing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprisingthe boats crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsyor timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made ashipkeeper it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin bynickname pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him beforeye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight sogloomyjollyin outer aspect pip and doughboy made a match like a black pony anda white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour drivenin one eccentric span but while hapless doughboy was by nature dulland torpid in his intellects pip though over tenderhearted was atbottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightnesspeculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays andfestivities with finer freer relish than any other race for blacksthe years calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixtyfivefourth of julys and new years days nor smile so while i write thatthis little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancybehold yon lustrous ebony panelled in kings cabinets but pip lovedlife and all lifes peaceable securities so that the panicstrikingbusiness in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped hadmost sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seenwhat was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to beluridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed himoff to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tollandcounty in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic onthe green and at melodious eventide with his gay haha had turnedthe round horizon into one starbelled tambourine so though in theclear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck thepurewatered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunningjeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre helays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sunbut by some unnatural gases then come out those fiery effulgencesinfernally superb then the evilblazing diamond once the divinestsymbol of the crystal skies looks like some crownjewel stolen fromthe king of hell but let us to the storyit came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubbs afteroarsmanchanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimedand temporarily pip was put into his placethe first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousnessbut happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale andtherefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observinghim took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousnessto the utmost for he might often find it needfulnow upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and asthe fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap whichhappened in this instance to be right under poor pips seat theinvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle inhand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whaleline coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so asto become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water thatinstant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftlystraightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks ofthe boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had takenseveral turns around his chest and necktashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt hehated pip for a poltroon snatching the boatknife from its sheath hesuspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubbexclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pips blue choked faceplainly looked do for gods sake all passed in a flash in less thanhalf a minute this entire thing happeneddamn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip wassavedso soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed byyells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting theseirregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain businesslikebut still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that doneunofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was neverjump from a boat pip exceptbut all the rest was indefinite as thesoundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is yourtrue motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when leap fromthe boat is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that ifhe should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would beleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenlydropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick tothe boat pip or by the lord i wont pick you up if you jump mindthat we cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale wouldsell for thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that inmind and dont jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hintedthat though man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animalwhich propensity too often interferes with his benevolencebut we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it wasunder very similar circumstances to the first performance but thistime he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale startedto run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellerstrunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautifulbounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatlystretching away all round to the horizon like goldbeaters skinhammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pipsebon head showed like a head of cloves no boatknife was lifted whenhe fell so rapidly astern stubbs inexorable back was turned upon himand the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shorelessocean was between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poorpip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonelycastaway though the loftiest and the brightestnow in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to thepractised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore but the awfullonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in themiddle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it markhow when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closelythey hug their ship and only coast along her sidesbut had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate nohe did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wakeand he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pipvery quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerationstowards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not alwaysmanifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instancesnot unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward socalled is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar tomilitary navies and armiesbut it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenlyspying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase andstubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intentupon his fish that pips ringed horizon began to expand around himmiserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued himbut from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot suchat least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite bodyup but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely thoughrather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes ofthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyesand the misermerman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among thejoyous heartless everjuvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinousgodomnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of watersheaved the colossal orbs he saw gods foot upon the treadle of theloom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad somans insanity is heavens sense and wandering from all mortal reasonman comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason isabsurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromisedindifferent as his godfor the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in thatfishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen whatlike abandonment befell myselfchapter 94 a squeeze of the handthat whale of stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to thepequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operationspreviously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling ofthe heidelburgh tun or casewhile some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed indragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm andwhen the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulatedere going to the tryworks of which anonit had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when withseveral others i sat down before a large constantines bath of it ifound it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling aboutin the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps backinto fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times thissperm was such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetenersuch a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in itfor only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as itwere to serpentine and spiraliseas i sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitterexertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship underindolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my handsamong those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almostwithin the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged alltheir opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up

with a bestreakedsnowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson andpurple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reasonit is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once istole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i shouldconceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might havetasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after thevenison season and that particular venison season contemporary with anunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagnethere is another substance and a very singular one which turns up inthe course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzlingadequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellationoriginal with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substanceit is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in thetubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting ihold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the casecoalescinggurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen butsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates thedark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of thegreenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of thoseinferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathannippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whalesvocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whalemansnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the taperingpart of leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for therest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved alongthe oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by namelessblandishments as of magic allures along with it all impuritiesbut to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is atonce to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with itsinmates this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle forthe blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when theproper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is ascene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit bya dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen theygenerally go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademan thewhalingpike is similar to a frigates boardingweapon of the samename the gaff is something like a boathook with his gaff thegaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it fromslipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile thespademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it intothe portable horsepieces this spade is sharp as hone can make it thespademans feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimesirresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one ofhis own toes or one of his assistants would you be very muchastonished toes are scarce among veteran blubberroom menchapter 95 the cassockhad you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of thispostmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh thewindlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no smallcuriosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seenthere lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrouscistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lowerjaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would sosurprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger thana kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base andjetblack as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed itis or rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as thatfound in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and forworshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed theidol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron as darklyset forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of kingslook at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along andassisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the marinerscall it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were agrenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon theforecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark peltas an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the peltinside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so asalmost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread inthe rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing somethree feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting twoslits for armholes at the other end he lengthwise slips himselfbodily into it the mincer now stands before you invested in the fullcanonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order thisinvestiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in thepeculiar functions of his officethat office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for thepots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horseplanted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneathit into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a raptorators desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpitintent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what alad for a pope were this mincerbible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the matesto the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into asthin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business ofboiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerablyincreased besides perhaps improving it in qualitychapter 96 the tryworksbesides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardlydistinguished by her tryworks she presents the curious anomaly of themost solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting thecompleted ship it is as if from the open field a brickkiln weretransported to her planksthe tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast the mostroomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strengthfitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick andmortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height thefoundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmlysecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on allsides and screwing it down to the timbers on the flanks it is casedwith wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battenedhatchway removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two innumber and each of several barrels capacity when not in use theyare kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstoneand sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls during thenightwatches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coilthemselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing themoneman in each pot side by sidemany confidential communications arecarried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profoundmathematical meditation it was in the left hand trypot of the pequodwith the soapstone diligently circling round me that i was firstindirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodiesgliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend fromany point in precisely the same timeremoving the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the baremasonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths ofthe furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fittedwith heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is preventedfrom communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoirextending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnelinserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water asfast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open directfrom the rear wall and here let us go back for a momentit was about nine oclock at night that the pequods tryworks werefirst started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to overseethe businessall ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire theworks this was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrustinghis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it saidthat in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryworks has to be fedfor a time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means ofquick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried outthe crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters stillcontains considerable of its unctuous properties these fritters feedthe flames like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsumingmisanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns byhis own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke ishorrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but youmust live in it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odorabout it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smellslike the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for thepitby midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from thecarcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild oceandarkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierceflames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues andilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greekfire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned tosome vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of thebold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broadsheets of flame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates andfolded them in conflagrationsthe hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a widehearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes ofthe pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers with hugepronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scaldingpots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames dartedcurling out of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolledaway in sullen heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch ofthe boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their facesopposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide woodenhearth was the windlass this served for a seasofa here lounged thewatch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of thefire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawnyfeatures now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beardsand the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these werestrangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as theynarrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terrortold in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwardsout of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in theirfront the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge prongedforks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and theship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell furtherand further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfullychamped the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her onall sides then the rushing pequod freighted with savages and ladenwith fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness ofdarkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commanderssoulso seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silentlyguided the way of this fireship on the sea wrapped for thatinterval in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness themadness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiendshapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these atlast begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield tothat unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at amidnight helmbut that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicablething occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i washorribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jawbone tillersmote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum ofsails just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes wereopen i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids andmechanically stretching them still further apart but spite of allthis i could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemedbut a minute since i had been watching the card by the steady binnaclelamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now andthen made ghastly by flashes of redness uppermost was the impressionthat whatever swift rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound toany haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern a stark bewilderedfeeling as of death came over me convulsively my hands grasped thetiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow insome enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with methought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and wasfronting the ships stern with my back to her prow and the compass inan instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flyingup into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and howgrateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night andthe fatal contingency of being brought by the leelook not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thyhand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the firsthint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when itsredness makes all things look ghastly tomorrow in the natural sunthe skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forkingflames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief theglorious golden glad sun the only true lampall others but liarsnevertheless the sun hides not virginias dismal swamp nor romesaccursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles ofdeserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not the oceanwhich is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of thisearth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrowin him that mortal man cannot be truenot true or undeveloped withbooks the same the truest of all men was the man of sorrows and thetruest of all books is solomons and ecclesiastes is the fine hammeredsteel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got holdof unchristian solomons wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals andjails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk ofoperas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devilsall of sick men and throughout a carefree lifetime swears by rabelaisas passing wise and therefore jollynot that man is fitted to sitdown on tombstones and break the green damp mould with unfathomablywondrous solomonbut even solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way ofunderstanding shall remain ie even while living in thecongregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest itinvert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdomthat is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is

gorge isin the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagleis still higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soarchapter 97 the lamphad you descended from the pequods tryworks to the pequodsforecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one singlemoment you would have almost thought you were standing in someilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they layin their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness ascore of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyesin merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk ofqueens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble indarkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as heseeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth

the prairie hunts up his ownsupper of gamechapter 98 stowing down and clearing upalready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar offdescried from the masthead how he is chased over the watery moorsand slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towedalongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled theheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed hisgreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how indue time he is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach andabednego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through thefirebut now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part ofthe description by rehearsingsinging if i maythe romantic proceedingof decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into thehold where once again leviathan returns to his native profunditiessliding along beneath the surface as before but alas never more torise and blowwhile still warm the oil like hot punch is received into thesixbarrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rollingthis way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewedround and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scootacross the slippery deck like so many land slides till at lastmanhandled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops raprap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex officioevery sailor is a cooperat length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then thegreat hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown openand down go the casks to their final rest in the sea this done thehatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled upin the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkableincidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks streamwith freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarterdeck enormousmasses of the whales head are profanely piled great rusty casks lieabout as in a brewery yard the smoke from the tryworks has besootedall the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness theentire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the dinis deafeningbut a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in thisselfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats and tryworksyou would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with amost scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oilpossesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why thedecks never look so white as just after what they call an affair ofoil besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale apotent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the backof the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quicklyexterminates it hands

likewise faithfully cleansed and put away thegreat hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the tryworks completelyhiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled inunseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry ofalmost the entire ships company the whole of this conscientious dutyis at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their ownablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to theimmaculate deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms newleaped fromout the daintiest hollandnow with elated step they pace the planks in twos and

multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not beenadded how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his moodhe was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangelyeyeing the particular object before him when he halted before thebinnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in thecompass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity ofhis purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before themainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the rivetedgold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness onlydashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulnessbut one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newlyattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it asthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself insome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and somecertain significance lurks in all things else all things are

hiscrew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of thestranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in theexcitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of hisleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but hisown and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanicalcontrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged andshipped in any other vessel at a moments warning now it is no veryeasy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to itlike whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open

before been hinted perhaps that every little untowardcircumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from hisluckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab andin the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of thetwo officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by theperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him apair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did not seemto bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of a cripple touse their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minutebecause the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stoodcried out i see i seeavast heaving there jump boys and swingover the cuttingtackleas good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or twoprevious and the great tackles were still aloft and the massivecurved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the endthis was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it allslid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sittingin the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and thengiving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped tohoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the runningparts of the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the highbulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory armfrankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahabputting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like twoswordfish blades cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty letus shake bones togetheran arm and a legan arm that never canshrink dye see and a leg that never can run where didst thou seethe white whalehow long agothe white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towardsthe east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been atelescope there i saw him on the line last seasonand he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down fromthe capstan and resting on the englishmans shoulder as he did soaye he was the cause of it at least and that leg toospin me the yarn said ahab how was itit was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the linebegan the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that timewell one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boatfastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that wentmilling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dishby sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breachesfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milkywhitehead and hump all crows feet and wrinklesit was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspendedbreathand harpoons sticking in near his starboard finaye ayethey were minemy irons cried ahab exultinglybut ongive me a chance then said the englishman goodhumoredly wellthis old greatgrandfather with the white head and hump runs allafoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fastlineaye i seewanted to part it free the fastfishan old tricki knowhimhow it was exactly continued the onearmed commander i do notknow but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught theresomehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulledon the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the otherwhales that went off to windward all fluking seeing how mattersstood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest iever saw sir in my lifei resolved to capture him spite of theboiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the haphazard line wouldget loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have adevil of a boats crew for a pull on a whaleline seeing all this isay i jumped into my

atthe same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went downlike a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along nearme caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder

myselfthatis to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergyam a strict totalabstinence man i never drinkwater cried the captain he never drinks it its a sort of fits tohim fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go ongo on withthe arm storyyes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observingsir before captain boomers facetious interruption that spite of mybest and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worsethe truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever sawmore than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the leadline in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off itcame but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing isagainst all rulepointing at it with the marlingspikethat is thecaptains work not

world bunger when you die you ought to die inpickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascalwhat became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had beenimpatiently listening to this byplay between the two englishmenoh cried the onearmed captain oh yes well after he sounded wedidnt see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted ididnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a tricktill some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard aboutmoby dickas some call himand then i knew it was hedidst thou cross his wake againtwicebut could not fastendidnt want to try to aint one limb enough what should i do withoutthis other arm and im thinking moby dick doesnt bite so much as heswallowswell then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait toget the right do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematicallybowing to each captain in successiondo you know gentlemen that thedigestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divineprovidence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digesteven a mans arm and he knows it too so that what you take for thewhite whales malice is only his awkwardness for he never means toswallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints butsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient ofmine in ceylon that making believe swallow jackknives once upon atime let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for atwelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up insmall tacks dye see no possible way for him to digest thatjackknife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily systemyes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mindto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burialto the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whalehave another chance at you shortly thats allno thank ye bunger said the english captain hes welcome to thearm he has since i cant help it and didnt know him then but not toanother one no more white whales for me ive lowered for him onceand that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him iknow that and there is a shipload of precious sperm in him but harkye hes best let alone dont you think so captainglancing at theivory leghe is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best letalone that accursed thing is not always what least allures hes all amagnet how long since thou sawst him last which way headingbless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried bunger stoopinglywalking round ahab and like a

fedallahbut fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks totake the boats steering oar and ahab swinging the cuttingtackletowards him commanded the ships sailors to stand by to lowerin a moment he was standing in the boats stern and the manilla menwere springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed himwith back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his ownahab stood upright till alongside of the pequodchapter 101 the decanterere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that shehailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderbymerchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house ofenderby  sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes notfar behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in pointof real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerousfishdocuments do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fitted outthe first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whalethough for some score of years previous ever since 1726 our valiantcoffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleetspursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic notelsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers werethe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great spermwhale and that for half a century they were the only people of thewhole globe who so harpooned himin 1778 a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purposeand at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded capehorn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of anysort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky oneand returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious spermthe amelias example was soon followed by other ships english andamerican and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific werethrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigablehouse again bestirred itself samuel and all his sonshow many theirmother only knowsand under their immediate auspices and partly ithink at their expense the british government was induced to send thesloopofwar rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the southsea commanded by a naval postcaptain the rattler made a rattlingvoyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but thisis not all in 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale shipof their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japanthat shipwell called the syrenmade a noble experimental cruise andit was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first becamegenerally known the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by acaptain coffin a nantucketerall honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists tothe present day though doubtless the original samuel must long agohave slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other worldthe ship named after him was worthy of the honor being a very fastsailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnightsomewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in theforecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumpseverysoul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that finegam i hadlong very long after old ahab touched her planks with hisivory heelit minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of thatship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i everlose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped itat the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for itssqually off there by patagonia and all handsvisitors and allwerecalled to reef topsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing eachother aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of ourjackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in thehowling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the mastsdid not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober thatwe had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray burstingdown the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it tomy tastethe beef was finetough but with body in it they said it wasbullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know forcertain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantialsymmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied thatyou could feel them and roll them about in you after they wereswallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked theirpitching out of you like billiardballs the breadbut that couldnt behelped besides it was an antiscorbutic in short the breadcontained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not verylight and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when youate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering thedimensions of the cooks boilers including his own live parchmentboilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship ofgood fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all andcapital from boot heels to hatbandbut why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some otherenglish whalers i know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitableships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and thejoke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing iwill tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers ismatter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing ofhistorical whale research when it has seemed neededthe english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanderszealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extantin the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touchingplenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the englishmerchantship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hencein the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal andnatural but incidental and particular and therefore must have somespecial origin which is here pointed out and will be still furtherelucidatedduring my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon anancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knewmust be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore iconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdamcooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i wasreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of onefitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned manprofessor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa clausand st potts to whom i handed the work for translation giving him abox of sperm candles for his troublethis same dr snodhead so soon ashe spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean thecooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned lowdutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among othersubjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fisheryand in this chapter it was headed smeer or fat that i found along detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodheadi transcribe the following400000 lbs of beef 60000 lbs friesland pork 150000 lbs of stockfish 550000 lbs of biscuit 72000 lbs of soft bread 2800 firkinsof butter 20000 lbs texel  leyden cheese 144000 lbs cheeseprobably an inferior article 550 ankers of geneva 10800 barrels ofbeermost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so inthe present case however where the reader is flooded with wholepipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheerat the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all thisbeer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts wereincidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonicapplication and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of myown touching the probable quantity of stockfish etc consumed byevery low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergenwhale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel andleyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to theirnaturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by thenature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their gamein those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimauxcountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers oftrain oilthe quantity of beer too is very large 10800 barrels now as thosepolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of thatclimate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemenincluding the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did notmuch exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men to each of theirfleet of 180 sail we have 5400 low dutch seamen in all therefore isay we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeksallowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of ginnow whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one mightfancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in aboats head and take good aim at flying whales this would seemsomewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too butthis was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well withthe constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer wouldbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the masthead and boozy in hisboat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedfordbut no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers oftwo or three centuries ago were high livers and that the englishwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they whencruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of theworld get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties thedecanterchapter 102 a bower in the arsacideshitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chieflydwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detailupon some few interior structural features but to a large and thoroughsweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him stillfurther and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his gartersand casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermostbones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in hisunconditional skeletonbut how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in thefishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of thewhale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectureson the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up aspecimen rib for

how you seize the privilege of jonah alonethe privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the raftersridgepole sleepers and underpinnings making up the framework ofleviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries andcheeseries in his bowelsi confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very farbeneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessedwith an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belongedto a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for hispoke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for theheads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using myboathatchet and jackknife and breaking the seal and reading all thecontents of that young cuband as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in theirgigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebtedto my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacidesfor being at tranque years ago when attached to the tradingship deyof algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays withthe lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a seasideglen not very far distant from what our sailors called bambootown hiscapitalamong many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being giftedwith a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had broughttogether in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of hispeople could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful deviceschiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes andall these distributed among whatever natural wonders thewonderfreighted tributerendering waves had cast upon his shoreschief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after anunusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with hishead against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopingsseemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped ofits fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sunthen the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen wherea grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered itthe ribs were hung with trophies the vertebræ were carved witharsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priestskept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head againsent forth its vapory spout while suspended from a bough theterrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhungsword that so affrighted damoclesit was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glenthe trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap theindustrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeouscarpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp andwoof and the

all material factories the spokenwords that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same wordsare plainly heard without the walls bursting from the openedcasements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then beheedful for so in all this din of the great worlds loom thysubtlest thinkings may be overheard afarnow amid the green liferestless loom of that arsacidean wood thegreat white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler yetas the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed aroundhim the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven overwith the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure buthimself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grimgod wived with youthful life and begat him curlyheaded gloriesnow when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw theskull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the realjet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as anobject of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priestsshould swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i pacedbefore this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke through the ribsandwith a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its manywinding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was out andfollowing it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw noliving

rib how now they shouted darstthou measure this our god thats for us aye priestswell how longdo ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among themconcerning feet and inches they cracked each others sconces withtheir yardsticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chancei quickly concluded my own admeasurementsthese admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be itrecorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fanciedmeasurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you canrefer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tellme in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country wherethey have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales likewisei have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire theyhave what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of agreenland or river whale in the united states moreover at a place inyorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir cliffordconstable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but ofmoderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friendking tranquosin both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletonsbelonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similargrounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sirclifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sircliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a greatchest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bonycavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day uponhis lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoors andshutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch ofkeys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peepat the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear theecho in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalledview from his foreheadthe skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copiedverbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wildwanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preservingsuch valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wishedthe other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was thencomposingat least what untattooed parts might remaini did nottrouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at allenter into a congenial admeasurement of the whalechapter 103 measurement of the whales skeletonin the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plainstatement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeletonwe are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful hereaccording to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly baseupon captain scoresbys estimate of seventy tons for the largest sizedgreenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my carefulcalculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude betweeneightyfive and ninety feet in length and something less than fortyfeet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at leastninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he wouldconsiderably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of onethousand one hundred inhabitantsthink you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put tothis leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsmans imaginationhaving already in various ways put before you his skull spoutholejaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall nowsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of hisunobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large aproportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far themost complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning itin this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or underyour arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notionof the general structure we are about to viewin length the sperm whales skeleton at tranque measured seventytwofeet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must havebeen ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about onefifth in length compared with the living body of this seventytwofeet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fiftyfeet of plain backbone attached to this backbone for something lessthan a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribswhich once enclosed his vitalsto me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spineextending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembledthe hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only sometwenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwisefor the time but a long disconnected timberthe ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck wasnearly six feet long the second third and fourth were eachsuccessively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or oneof the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches fromthat part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last onlyspanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all borea seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the mostarched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to layfootpath bridges over small streamsin considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with thecircumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton ofthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest ofthe tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of thefish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth ofthe invested body of this particular whale must have been at leastsixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little morethan eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notionof the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where inow saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round withtons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more forthe ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place ofthe weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blankhow vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to tryto comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over hisdead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only inthe heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of hisangry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fullyinvested whale be truly and livingly found outbut the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with acrane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but nowits done it looks much like pompeys pillarthere are forty and odd vertebræ in all which in the skeleton are notlocked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on agothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest amiddle one is in width something less than three feet and in depthmore than four the smallest where the spine tapers away into thetail is only two inches in width and looks something like a whitebilliardball i was told that there were still smaller ones but theyhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priests childrenwho had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that thespine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last intosimple childs playchapter 104 the fossil whalefrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereonto enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could notcompress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperialfolio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail andthe yards he measures about the waist only think of the giganticinvolutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cablesand hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of alineofbattleshipsince i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me toapprove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise notoverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning himout to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described himin most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it nowremains to magnify him in an archæological fossiliferous andantediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than theleviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemedunwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the caseis altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiestwords of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has beenconvenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i haveinvariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchasedfor that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personalbulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale authorlike meone often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subjectthough it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing ofthis leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placardcapitals give me a condors quill give me vesuvius crater for aninkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning mythoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with theiroutreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the wholecircle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men andmastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramasof empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excludingits suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large andliberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book youmust choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever bewritten on the flea though many there be who have tried itere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present mycredentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time ihave been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals andwells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise byway of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in theearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters nowalmost completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what arecalled the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rateintercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whoseremote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossilwhales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is thelast preceding the superficial formations and though none of themprecisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yetsufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their takingrank as cetacean fossilsdetached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bonesand skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervalsbeen found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in englandin scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabamaamong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in theyear 1779 was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short streetopening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bonesdisinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleonstime cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to someutterly unknown leviathanic speciesbut by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almostcomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awestrickencredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of thefallen angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile andbestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones ofit being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turnedout that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departedspecies a significant illustration of the fact again and againrepeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes butlittle clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owenrechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before thelondon geological society pronounced it in substance one of the mostextraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blottedout of existencewhen i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusksjaws ribs and vertebræ all characterized by partial resemblances tothe existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearing onthe other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronicalleviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back tothat wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun fortime began with man here saturns grey chaos rolls over me and iobtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities whenwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics andin all the 25000 miles of this worlds circumference not aninhabitable hands breadth of land was visible then the whole worldwas the whales and king of creation he left his wake along thepresent lines of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigreelike leviathan ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaohsmethuselah seems a schoolboy i look round to shake hands with shem iam horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of theunspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all timemust needs exist after all humane ages are overbut not alone has this leviathan left his preadamite traces in thestereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed hisancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claimfor them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakableprint of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah somefifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling asculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffinsand dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globeof the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore wasthere swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon wascradlednor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquityof the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down bythe venerable john leo the old barbary travellernot far from the seaside they have a temple the rafters and beamsof which are made of whalebones for whales of a monstrous size areoftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imaginethat by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale canpass it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is thaton either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles intothe sea and wound the whales when they light upon em they keep awhales rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon theground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of whichcannot be reached by a man upon a camels back this rib says johnleo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it theirhistorians affirm that a prophet who prophesyd of mahomet came fromthis temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonaswas cast forth by the whale at the base of the templein this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be anantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship therechapter 105 does the whales magnitude diminishwill he perishinasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us fromthe headwaters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whetherin the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from theoriginal bulk of his siresbut upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of thepresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains arefound in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological periodprior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system thosebelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlieronesof all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is thealabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less thanseventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seenthat the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeleton of alarge sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemens authoritythat sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at thetime of capturebut may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are anadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods mayit not be that since adams time they have degeneratedassuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts ofsuch gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally forpliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk andaldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthropewalks and thames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks andsolander cookes naturalists we find a danish member of the academyof sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydansiskur orwrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is threehundred and sixty feet and lacépède the french naturalist in hiselaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page3 sets down the right whale at one hundred metres three hundred andtwentyeight feet and this work was published so late as ad 1825but will any whaleman believe these stories no the whale of today isas big as his ancestors in plinys time and if ever i go where plinyis i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him sobecause i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummiesthat were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do notmeasure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socksand while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldestegyptian and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which theyare drawn just as plainly prove that the highbred stallfed prizecattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude thefattest of pharaohs fat kine in the face of all this i will notadmit that of all animals the whale alone should have degeneratedbut still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the morerecondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscientlookouts at the mastheads of the whaleships now penetrating eventhrough behrings straits and into the remotest secret drawers andlockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted alongall continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can longendure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must notat last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like thelast man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the finalpuffcomparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalowhich not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands theprairies of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes andscowled with their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populousrivercapitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollaran inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seemfurnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedyextinctionbut you must look at this matter in every light though so short aperiod agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo in illinoisexceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present daynot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though thecause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the fardifferent nature of the whalehunt peremptorily forbids so ingloriousan end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whalesfor fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thankgod if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in thedays of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the westwhen the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wildernessand a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number ofmonths mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slainnot forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if needwere could be statistically statednor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of thegradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in formeryears the latter part of the last century say these leviathans insmall pods were encountered much oftener than at present and inconsequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much moreremunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whalesinfluenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immensecaravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokesand pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast butwidely separated unfrequent armies that is all and equallyfallacious seems the conceit that because the socalled whalebonewhales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding withthem hence that species also is declining for they are only beingdriven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivenedwith their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has beenvery recently startled by the unfamiliar spectaclefurthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have twofirm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remainimpregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frostyswiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannasand glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resortto their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriersand walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmedcircle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from manbut as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for onecachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that thispositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalionsbut though for some time past a number of these whales not less than13000 have been annually slain on the nor west coast by theamericans alone yet there are considerations which render even thiscircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in thismatternatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousnessof the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say toharto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting theking of siam took 4000 elephants that in those regions elephants arenumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seemsno reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been huntedfor thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by allthe successive monarchs of the eastif they still survive there ingreat numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting sincehe has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large asall asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all theisles of the sea combinedmoreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity ofwhales their probably attaining the age of a century and moretherefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generationsmust be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea ofby imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults ofcreation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women andchildren who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding thiscountless host to the present human population of the globewherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in hisspecies however perishable in his individuality he swam the seasbefore the continents broke water he once swam over the site of thetuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noahs flood hedespised noahs ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded likethe netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale willstill survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorialflood spout his frothed defiance to the skieschapter 106 ahabs legthe precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuelenderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence tohis own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of hisboat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shock and whenafter gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there he sovehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman itwas as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enoughthen the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist andwrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearanceslusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthyand indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all hispervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to thecondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had notbeen very long prior to the pequods sailing from nantucket that hehad been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensibleby some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty hisivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stakewisesmitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extremedifficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely curednor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that allthe anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue ofa former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the mostpoisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably asthe sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicityall miserable events do naturally beget their like yea more thanequally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of griefgo further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint ofthis that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings thatwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to themfor the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by thejoychildlessness of all hells despair whereas some guilty mortalmiseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternallyprogressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint ofthis there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of thething for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicitiesever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but atbottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men anarchangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie theobvious deduction to trail the genealogies of these high mortalmiseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of thegods so that in the face of all the glad haymaking suns and softcymballing round harvestmoons we must needs give in to this thatthe gods themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sadbirthmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in thesignersunwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might moreproperly in set way have been disclosed before with many otherparticulars concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to somewhy it was that for a certain period both before and after thesailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with suchgrandlamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval soughtspeechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the deadcaptain pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no meansadequate though indeed as touching all ahabs deeper part everyrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatorylight but in the end it all came out this one matter did at leastthat direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness andnot only this but to that evercontracting dropping circle ashorewho for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approachto him to that timid circle the above hinted casualtyremaining as itdid moodily unaccounted for by ahabinvested itself with terrors notentirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails so thatthrough their zeal for him they had all conspired so far as in themlay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence itwas that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did ittranspire upon the pequods decksbut be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the airor the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or notwith earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he tookplain practical procedureshe called the carpenterand when that functionary appeared before him he bade him withoutdelay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see himsupplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory sperm whale whichhad thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a carefulselection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be securedthis done the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed thatnight and to provide all the fittings for it independent of thosepertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ships forge wasordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold andto accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed atonce to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be neededchapter 107 the carpenterseat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take highabstracted man alone and he seems a

eternally holds its peaceand ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet wasthis halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared anallramifying heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with anold crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreakednow and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might haveserved to pass the time during the midnight

it was his orderswere executed and the burtons were hoistedchapter 110 queequeg in his coffinupon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the holdwere perfectly sound and that the leak

hoisted out till at last thepiled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed underfoot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled androlled in the sea like an airfreighted demijohn topheavy was theship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well wasit that the typhoons did not visit them thennow at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fastbosomfriend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nighto his endless endbe it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknowndignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain thehigher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who asharpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale butaswe have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling sea andfinally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating allday in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle theclumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalementhe harpooneers are the holders so calledpoor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you shouldhave stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there wherestripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling aboutamid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottomof a well and a well or an icehouse it somehow proved to him poorpagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings hecaught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last aftersome days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sillof the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those fewlonglingering days till there seemed but little left of him but hisframe and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and hischeekbones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fullerand fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly butdeeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimonyto that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened andlike circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so hiseyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awethat cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side ofthis waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as anybeheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is trulywondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books andthe drawing near of death which alike levels all alike impresses allwith a last revelation which only an author from the dead couldadequately tell so thatlet us say it againno dying chaldee or greekhad higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades yousaw creeping over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in hisswaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to hisfinal rest and the oceans invisible floodtide lifted him higher andhigher towards his destined heavennot a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himselfwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour heasked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day wasjust breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he hadchanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the richwarwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that allwhalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoesand that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it wasnot unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a deadwarrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floatedaway to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that thestars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their ownmild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so formthe white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at thethought of being buried in his hammock according to the usualseacustom tossed like something vile to the deathdevouring sharksno he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenialto him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoeswere without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering andmuch leeway adown the dim agesnow when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenterwas at once commanded to do queequegs bidding whatever it mightinclude there was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboardwhich upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginalgroves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffinwas recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of theorder than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferentpromptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and tookqueequegs measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequegsperson as he shifted the ruleah poor fellow hell have to die now ejaculated the long islandsailorgoing to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake and generalreference now transferringly measured on it the exact length thecoffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting twonotches at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and histools and to workwhen the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted helightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiringwhether they were ready for it yet in that directionoverhearing the indignant but halfhumorous cries with which the peopleon deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every onesconsternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought tohim nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals somedying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they willshortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to beindulgedleaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with anattentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stockdrawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin alongwith one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request alsobiscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of freshwater was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped upin the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up fora pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed thathe might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay withoutmoving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out hislittle god yojo then crossing his arms on his breast with yojobetween he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placedover him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there layqueequeg in his coffin with little but his

away and the sick man was replaced in his hammockbut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death nowthat his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soonthere seemed no need of the carpenters box and thereupon when someexpressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that thecause of his sudden convalescence was thisat a critical moment hehad just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undoneand therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yethe averred they asked him then whether to live or die was a matterof his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in aword it was queequegs conceit that if a man made up his mind tolive mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a galeor some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sortnow there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilizedthat while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescinggenerally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a dayso in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length aftersitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with avigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his armsand legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and thenspringing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoonpronounced himself fit for a fightwith a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest andemptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order theremany spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner ofgrotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he wasstriving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing onhis body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophetand seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had writtenout on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and amystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg inhis own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in onevolume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his ownlive heart beat against them and these mysteries were thereforedestined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereonthey were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thoughtit must have been which suggested to ahab that wild

and the sounds that came bearing downbefore the wind some few weeks after ahabs harpoon had been weldedit was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in herlast cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now inglad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriouslysailing round among the widelyseparated ships on the ground previousto pointing her prow for homethe three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow redbunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspendedbottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the longlower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacksof all colours were flying from her rigging on every side sidewayslashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of spermabove which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers ofthe same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazenlampas was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the mostsurprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising inthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months withoutsecuring a single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread beengiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additionalsupplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had metand these were stowed along the deck and in the captains andofficers staterooms even the cabin table itself had been knockedinto kindlingwood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of anoilbutt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in theforecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chestsand filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped ahead on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had pluggedhis spare coffeepot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed thesockets of their irons and filled them that indeed everything wasfilled with sperm except the captains pantaloons pockets and thosehe reserved to thrust his hands into in selfcomplacent testimony ofhis entire satisfactionas this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod thebarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawingstill nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her hugetrypots which covered with the parchmentlike poke or stomach skinof the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of theclenched hands of the crew on the quarterdeck the mates andharpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped withthem from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boatfirmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three longisland negroes with glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory werepresiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the shipscompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the tryworks fromwhich the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thoughtthey were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries theyraised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into thesealord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on theships elevated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama wasfull before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individualdiversionand ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and blackwith a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each otherswakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodingsas to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated thewhole striking contrast of the scenecome aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelors commander liftinga glass and a bottle in the airhast seen the white whale gritted ahab in replyno only heard of him but dont believe in him at all said theother goodhumoredly come

so go thy ways and i will mine forwardthere set all sail and keep her to the windand thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the otherstubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crewof the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards thereceding bachelor but the bachelors men never heeding their gaze forthe lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over thetaffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket asmall vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemedthereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial wasfilled with nantucket soundingschapter 116 the dying whalenot seldom in this life when on the right side fortunes favouritessail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of

sat watching the sharks that spectrally playedround the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails asound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgivenghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the airstarted from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee andhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in aflooded world i have dreamed it again

theslumbering crew arose from the boats bottom and ere noon the deadwhale was brought to the shipchapter 118 the quadrantthe season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahabcoming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman wouldostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run tothe braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixedon the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the shipsprow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard uponhigh noon and ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat wasabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine hislatitudenow in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets ofeffulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazingfocus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass the sky lookslacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and thisnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors ofgods throne well that ahabs quadrant was furnished with colouredglasses through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinginghis seated form to the roll of the ship and with hisastrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained in thatposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sunshould gain its precise meridian meantime while his whole attentionwas absorbed the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deckand with face thrown up like ahabs was eyeing the same sun with himonly the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face wassubdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desiredobservation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahabsoon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant thenfalling into a moments revery he again looked up towards the sun andmurmured to himself thou seamark thou high and mighty pilot thoutellest me truly where i ambut canst thou cast the least

windwardall is blackness of doom but to leeward homewardi see it lightens upthere but not with the lightningat that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness followingthe flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the sameinstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overheadwhos thereold thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to hispivothole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowedlances of firenow as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry offthe perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea someships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water butas this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end mayavoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantlytowing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interferingnot a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding thevessels way in the water because of all this the lower parts of aships lightningrods are not always overboard but are generally madein long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into thechains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may requirethe

his own little craft so that its gunwale violentlyjammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast itbut slippingbackward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames andimmediately shifting his tone he criedthe corpusants have mercy on usallto sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance ofthe calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate cursesfrom the

momentor two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some oneit was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was notthe same in the songno no it wasnt i said the corpusants have

thebracesthough not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghastmates thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry butdashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching theburning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing totransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropes endpetrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery

degree seemed then to be sharing hisfeelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though someof them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fearof fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almostwholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certainmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahabsfor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries butchancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed coppersighttubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deckthou poor proud heavengazer and suns pilot

sailmakers needlesquickaccessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now aboutto do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been torevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in amatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the oldman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsilypracticable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitioussailors without some shudderings and evil portentsmen said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed himthe things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old

eyes they awaited whatever magicmight follow but starbuck looked awaywith a blow from the topmaul ahab knocked off the steel head of thelance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining badehim hold it upright without its touching the deck then with themaul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod heplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less stronglyhammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as beforethen going through some small strange motions with itwhetherindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended toaugment the awe of the crew is uncertainhe called for linen threadand moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles thereand horizontally suspended the sailneedle by its middle over one ofthe compasscards at first the steel went round and round quiveringand vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place whenahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped franklyback from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards itexclaimedlook ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the levelloadstone the sun is east and that compass swears itone after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes couldpersuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunkawayin his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all hisfatal pridechapter 125 the log and linewhile now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the logand line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident relianceupon other means of determining the vessels place some merchantmenand many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heavethe log though at the same time and frequently more for forms sakethan anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate thecourse steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate ofprogression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the woodenreel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath therailing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun andwind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing thathung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as hehappened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnetscene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled hisfrantic oath about the level log and line the ship was sailingplungingly astern the billows rolled in riotsforward there heave the logtwo seamen came the goldenhued tahitian and the grizzly manxmantake the reel one of

steel and her progresssolely determined by ahabs level log and line the pequod held on herpath towards the equator making so long a passage through suchunfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sidewaysimpelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild allthese seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous anddesperate sceneat last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of theequatorial fishingground and in the deep darkness that goes beforethe dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watchthenheaded by flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild andunearthlylike halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all herodsmurdered innocentsthat one and all they started from their reveriesand for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned alltransfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wildcry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of thecrew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneersremained unappalled yet the grey manxmanthe oldest mariner ofalldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were thevoices of newly drowned men in the seabelow in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when hecame to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask notunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thusexplained the wonderthose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of greatnumbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams orsome dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship andkept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort ofwail but this only the more affected some of them because mostmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising notonly from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from thehuman look of their round heads and semiintelligent faces seenpeeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certaincircumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for menbut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausibleconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning atsunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the foreand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep forsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thuswith the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he hadnot been long at his perch when a cry was hearda cry and arushingand looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air andlooking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of theseathe lifebuoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern where italways hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize itand the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that itslowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore andthe studded ironbound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if toyield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard oneand thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look outfor the white whale on the white whales own peculiar ground that manwas swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at thetime indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event atleast as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing ofevil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presagedthey declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks theyhad heard the night before but again the old manxman said naythe lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to seeto it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as inthe feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of thevoyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directlyconnected with its final end whatever that might prove to betherefore they were going to leave the ships stern unprovided with abuoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted ahint concerning his coffina lifebuoy of a coffin cried starbuck startingrather queer that i should say said stubbit will make a good enough one said flask the

downupon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the timethe pequod was making good speed through the water but as thebroadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails allfell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled fromthe smitten hullbad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere hercommander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere hecould hopefully hail ahabs voice was heardhast seen the white whaleaye yesterday have ye seen a whaleboat adriftthrottling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected questionand would then have fain boarded the stranger when the strangercaptain himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descendingher side a few keen pulls and his boathook soon clinched thepequods mainchains and he sprang to the deck immediately he wasrecognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutationwas exchangedwhere was henot killednot killed cried ahab closely advancinghow was itit seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previouswhile three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal ofwhales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship andwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and headof moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far toleeward whereupon the fourth rigged boata reserved onehad beeninstantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind thisfourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed to have succeeded infasteningat least as well as the man at the masthead could tellanything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boatand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothingmore whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must haveindefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens there wassome apprehension but no positive alarm as yet the recall signalswere placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up herthree far to windward boatsere going in quest of the fourth one in theprecisely opposite directionthe ship had not only been necessitated toleave that boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time toincrease her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at lastsafe aboard she crowded all sailstunsail on stunsailafter themissing boat kindling a fire in her trypots for a beacon and everyother man aloft on the lookout but though when she had thus sailed asufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones whenlast seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull allaround her and not finding anything had again dashed on againpaused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doingtill daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had beenseenthe story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal hisobject in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with hisown in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five milesapart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it werei will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some onein that missing boat wore off that captains best coat mayhap hiswatchhes so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of twopious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the heightof the whaling season see flask only see how pale he lookspale inthe very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have beenthemy boy my own boy is among them for gods sakei beg iconjurehere exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far hadbut icily received his petition for eightandforty hours let mecharter your shipi will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for itifthere be no other wayfor eightandforty hours onlyonly thatyoumust oh you must and you shall do this thinghis son cried stubb oh its his son hes lost i take back thecoat and watchwhat says ahab we must save that boyhes drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manxsailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spiritsnow as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachelsthe more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of thecaptains sons among the number of the missing boats crew but amongthe number of the other boats crews at the same time but on theother hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of thechase there had been still another son as that for a time thewretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexitywhich was only solved for him by his chief mates instinctivelyadopting the ordinary procedure of a whaleship in such emergenciesthat is when placed between jeopardized but divided boats always topick up the majority first but the captain for some unknownconstitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and nottill forced to it by ahabs iciness did he allude to his one yetmissing boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with theearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketers paternal love hadthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of avocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor does itunfrequently occur that nantucket captains will send a son of suchtender age away from them for a protracted three or four years voyagein some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of awhalemans career shall be unenervated by any chance display of afathers natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness andconcernmeantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahaband ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but withoutthe least quivering of his owni will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to

from his enchantmentgardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into hisboat and returned to his shipsoon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vesselwas in view

redbilled savage seahawks which so often flyincommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in theselatitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round hishead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted athousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards andwent eddying again round his headbut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemednot to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have markedit much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the leastheedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning

from the scuttle in which he leaned and wentto his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffingup the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will in drawing nigh to somebarbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon thatpeculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the livingsperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any marinersurprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dogvaneand then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly aspossible ahab rapidly ordered the ships course to be slightlyaltered and the sail to be shortenedthe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicatedat daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly andlengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated waterywrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclike marks of some swifttiderip at the mouth of a deep rapid streamman the mastheads call all handsthundering with the butts of three clubbed

rippling playfully accompanying the shade andbehind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the movingvalley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose anddanced by his side but these were broken again by the light toes ofhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with theirfitful flight and like to some flagstaff rising from the painted hullof an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projectedfrom the white whales back and at intervals one of the cloud ofsofttoed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy overthe fish silently

beforeand thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea amongwaves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding rapture mobydick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of hissubmerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jawbut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for aninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginiasnatural bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the airthe grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sighthoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowlslongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he leftwith oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adriftthe three boats now stilly floated awaiting moby dicks reappearancean hour said ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazedbeyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooingvacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemedwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breezenow freshened the sea began to swellthe birdsthe birds cried tashtegoin long indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were nowall flying towards ahabs boat and when within a few yards beganfluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyousexpectant cries their vision was keener than mans ahab coulddiscover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and downinto its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than awhite weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as itrose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two longcrooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from theundiscoverable bottom it was moby dicks open mouth and scrolled jawhis vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the seathe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marbletomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirledthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling uponfedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows andseizing perths harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars andstand by to sternnow by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axisits bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yetunder water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with thatmalicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplantedhimself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated headlengthwise beneath the boatthrough and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled foran instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of abiting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within hismouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up intothe open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock the bluishpearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahabshead and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whalenow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse withunastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but thetigeryellow crew were tumbling over each others heads to gain theuttermost sternand now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as thewhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from hisbody being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at fromthe bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and whilethe other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisisimpossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious withthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive andhelpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seizedthe long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it fromits gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him thefrail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like anenormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely intwain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between thetwo floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping thecrew at the sternwreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to holdfast to the oars to lash them acrossat that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the firstto perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head amovement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand hadmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but onlyslipping further into the whales mouth and tilting over sideways asit slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled himout of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flatfaced upon thesearipplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a littledistance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in thebillows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled bodyso

the sperm whale it receives itsdesignation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminaryupanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise calledpitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must bestand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling himbut soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly roundand round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengefulwake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadlyassault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as theblood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochuss elephants in thebook of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of thewhales insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough hecould still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as thathelpless ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the leastchance shock might burst from the boats fragmentary stern fedallahincuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the otherdrifting end could not succor him more than enough was it for them tolook to themselves for so revolvingly appalling was the white whalesaspect and so planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he madethat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the otherboats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull intothe eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instantdestruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in thatcase could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes thenthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre hadnow become the old mans headmeantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the shipsmast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the sceneand was

case that when a boat is stove its crew being pickedup by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase isthus continued with what is called doublebanked oars it was thus nowbut the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of thewhale for he seemed to have treblebanked his every fin swimming witha velocity which plainly showed that if now under thesecircumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitelyprolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so longa period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thingbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itselfthen as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediatemeans of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for herand were soon swayed

stunsails like the doublejointed wings of analbatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of mobydick atthe well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout wasregularly announced from

pacing beneath his slouched hatat every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been droppedupon the quarterdeck and lay there reversed broken bow to shatteredstern at last he paused before it and as in an already overcloudedsky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the oldmans face there now stole some such added gloom as thisstubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though toevince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place inhis captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimedthethistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too

unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such isthe wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincibleconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucketcommanders that from the simple observation of a whale when lastdescried they will under certain given circumstances prettyaccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue toswim for a time while out of sight as well as his probable rate ofprogression during that period and in these cases somewhat as apilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending hewell knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but atsome further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takesthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the morecertainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to bevisited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale forafter being chased and diligently marked through several hours ofdaylight then when night obscures the fish the creatures futurewake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagaciousmind of the hunter as the pilots coast is to him so that to thishunters wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ inwater a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as thesteadfast land and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railwayis so familiarly known in its every pace that with watches in theirhands men time his rate as doctors that of a babys pulse and lightlysay of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such aspot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasionswhen these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deepaccording to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves somany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will haveabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but torender this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and thesea must be the whalemans

then disappearsit was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken someother thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved forhardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to itspin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made theair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles the triumphanthalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard asmuch nearer to the shipthan the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile aheadmoby dickbodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings notby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did thewhite whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrousphenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from thefurthest depths the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into thepure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam showshis place to the distance of seven miles and more in those momentsthe torn enraged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some casesthis breaching is his act of defiancethere she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in hisimmeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmonlike toheaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relievedagainst the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raisedfor the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier andstood there

crews ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he toldthem he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight upto his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limitsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelongvision but ere that close limit was gained and while yet all threeboats were plain as the ships three masts to his eye the white whalechurning himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it wererushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offeredappalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at himfrom every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plankof which those boats were made but skilfully manœuvred incessantlywheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a whileeluded him though at times but by a planks breadth while all thetime ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shredsbut at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossedand recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the threelines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselveswarped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though nowfor a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a moretremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out moreline and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhopingthat way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savagethan the embattled teeth of sharkscaught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoonsand lances with

withoutthe rays of steel dragged in the linebeyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sunderingthe rope near the chocksdropped the intercepted fagot of steel intothe sea and was all fast again that instant the white whale made asudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines by sodoing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flasktowards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on asurfbeaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in aboiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips ofthe wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftlystirred bowl of punchwhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out afterthe revolving linetubs oars and other floating furniture whileaslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitchinghis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb waslustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the oldmans linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool torescue whom he couldin that wild simultaneousness of a thousandconcreted perilsahabs yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towardsheaven by invisible wiresas arrowlike shooting perpendicularlyfrom the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against itsbottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fellagaingunwale downwardsand ahab and his men struggled out from underit like seals from a seaside cavethe first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction as hestruck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it to a littledistance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with hisback to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes fromside to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip orcrumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back andcame sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his workfor that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through theocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued hisleeward way at a travellers methodic paceas before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight againcame bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up thefloating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught atand safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders

ahab tossing the mates arm from him stand bythe crewin an instant the boat was pulling round close under the sternthe sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabinwindowthere o master my master come backbut ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then and theboat leaped onyet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship whennumbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneaththe hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every timethey dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat withtheir bites it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleboatsin those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following themin the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners ofmarching regiments in the east but these were the first sharks thathad been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been firstdescried and whether it was that ahabs crew were all suchtigeryellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to thesenses of the sharksa matter sometimes well known to affectthemhowever it was they seemed to follow that one boat withoutmolesting the othersheart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side andfollowing with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ring boldlyto that sightlowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed bythem openmouthed to the chase and this

withitwheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh ahabshuddershudderthe boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsadownward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded butintending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way alittle sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining theprofoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammeredagainst the opposing bowdrive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost headsdrive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin andno hearse can be mineand hemp only can kill me ha hasuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles thenquickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of iceswiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard asubterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled withtrailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwisebut obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mistit hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swampingback into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed foran instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower offlakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round themarble trunk of the whalegive way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward tothe attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded inhim moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fellfrom heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broadwhite forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted togetheras head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once moreflailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the twomates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bowsbut leaving ahabs almost without a scarwhile daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as thewhale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as heshot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed roundand round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns inwhich during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions ofthe lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen hissable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon oldahabthe harpoon dropped from his

escaping with thecorpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounterhad been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now againsteadily swimming forward and had almost passed the shipwhich thusfar had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for thepresent her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with hisutmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straightpath in the seaoh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the thirdday to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou thatmadly seekest himsetting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelledto leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was slidingby the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbucks face as heleaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about andfollow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwardshe saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the threemastheads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boatswhich had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work inrepairing them one after the other through the portholes as hesped he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busyingthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw allthis as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammersseemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now markingthat the vane or flag was gone from the mainmasthead he shouted totashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for anotherflag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mastwhether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance tohis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was somelatent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the whitewhales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidlynearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had notbeen so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the wavesthe unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck tothe boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the bladesbecame jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea atalmost every dipheed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pullon tis the better rest the sharks jaw than the yielding waterbut at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smallerthey will last long enough pull onbut who can tellhemutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or onahabbut pull on aye all alive nowwe near him the helm take thehelm let me passand so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forwardto the bows of the still flying boatat length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along withthe white whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of itsadvanceas the whale sometimes willand ahab was fairly within thesmoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curledround his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him whenwith body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to thepoise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into thehated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if suckedinto a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled hisnigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it sosuddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevatedpart of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more havebeen tossed into the sea as it was three of the oarsmenwho foreknewnot the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared forits effectsthese were flung out but so fell that in an instant twoof them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on acombing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third manhelplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimmingalmost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduatedinstantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the welteringsea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns withthe line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on theirseats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous linefelt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty airwhat breaks in me some sinew crackstis whole again oars oarsburst in upon himhearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whale wheeledround to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolutioncatching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeingin it the source of all

and round in one vortex carried thesmallest chip of the pequod out of sightbut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over thesunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of theerect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flagwhich calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroyingbillows they almost touchedat that instant a red

its natural homeamong the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego therethis bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing betweenthe hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherialthrill the submerged savage beneath in his deathgasp kept hishammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelicshrieks and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole
